Introduction

1	INTRODUCTION
This booklet is meant to accompany the basic textbook entitled “A Guided Tour through
Euro Area Economics”. The reason for preparing such a booklet lies in the fact that I have
been asked many times by my students to provide them with appropriate exercises in order
to allow them to test their knowledge. In line with this, here is the first edition of such
an exercise booklet. It goes without saying that the concrete outline follows the one of the
underlying textbook very closely.
