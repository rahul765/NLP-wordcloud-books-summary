ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Preface

PREFACE
A handbook is a concise manual or a reference book that provides specific information or
instruction about a subject. The topic taken up here is globalization, a fascinating subject
that has been at the forefront of public discussions for quite some time.
To the leading proponents of globalization, the secret to economic prosperity lies in finding
ever-expanding markets. Thus globalization is seen to be by far the best way to achieve
economic development and end poverty for big chunks of humanity.
Unfortunately globalization is not an unmixed blessing. While “think global, act local” may
be a popular slogan, the picture on the ground is hardly perfect. There is in fact a growing
sense of unease about all that globalization brings, which raises more questions than answers.
This handbook touches upon a whole range of issues surrounding globalization in the
hope that these may then be pursued by the reader at leisure. It resembles an instructor’s
notebook for undergraduates that assumes some familiarity with basic economic principles.
Consequently, it should be of interest to anyone who wants an introduction to the fascinating
topic of globalization.
The language employed here is colloquial and nonspecialized. A conscious effort has been
made to maintain an informal tone and avoid weighty scholarly deliberations as well as
flashy empiricism. Many current views on globalization as expressed in the popular presses
have been incorporated here in the interest of maintaining currency and relevance.
The few specialized terms and terminologies that have slipped in nonetheless are clearly
defined along the way so as not to detract from the main theme. Since the United States
is a commanding presence in the global marketplace, the American perspective has been
employed as the primary vantage for this handbook. The fairly extensive list of references
supplied at the end should also serve as a useful source for further readings.
In what follows, the history and mechanics of globalization are examined first before exploring
its theoretical underlining. What globalization means for the environment, the changing
nature of work, wages and the complex world of finance and investment are examined next.
The handbook wraps up the subject with a look at the policy questions and the long-term
prospects for the global economy.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Preface

Chapter 1 provides an account of the historical origins of globalization and its essential
features before considering the tremendous possibilities for commerce opened up by the
information revolution. The curious phenomenon of hyper- globalization is examined next
along with the associated complexities.
Chapter 2 explores the structural mechanics of globalization. This involves the simple
logic of trade, the evolution of global trade agreements, the costs of trade, the mechanics
of currency markets and the nature of global capital flows. The chapter concludes with a
look at the somewhat weighty question of economic freedom.
Chapter 3 presents an overview of the various popular theories on globalization. As may be
expected, the early enthusiasm in academic circles concerning globalization produced several
strains of theorizing across disciplinary boundaries. From mainline economic theorizing all
the way to the radical perspective we are thus treated to a multiplicity of flavors concerning
globalization. The chapter concludes with a quick look at the conceptual limitations and
the questions that are largely left unanswered.
Chapter 4 looks at how globalization impacts on the endowment of natural resources
and how environmental stresses and resource scarcities arise. The discussion extends to
the issue of geopolitical uncertainty that often feeds upon environmental stresses. The
chapter wraps up with a look at the promise of renewable resources and the related issue
of sustainable development.
Chapter 5 examines the changing the nature of work and wages brought about by globalization.
After a discussion of labor market operations, attention turns to the changing work patterns,
alterations in labor standards, changing migration patterns, altered perceptions of income
security and what all of it means for the economic prospects of labor around the globe.
Chapter 6 examines the crucial links between finance and investment, the mechanics of
integrated financial markets and the nature of global investments. The analysis concludes
with an examination of the risks and other challenges posed by globalized finance.
Chapter 7 explores the nature of economic fluctuations and how these play out within
the dynamics of globalization. The analysis extends to the challenges globalization poses
for policy makers.

Chapter 8 looks at the paradoxes and puzzles posed by globalization. The economic success
stories from Southeast Asia provide the backdrop and the ongoing economic miracle of
China takes center stage. The chapter concludes with look at the possibility of a backlash
to the entire globalization process and what it might mean for our economic future.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Foreword

FOREWORD
The average Economics textbook at the collegiate level will cost a student well above $200;
Economics of Globalization: A Handbook will cost a student nothing. Let me first start off by
discrediting the old adage: “you get what you pay for”, because in the case of this handbook
it couldn’t be further from the truth. The origins of the handbook are derived from over
30 years of teaching and research experience that have dealt with the challenging concept
of globalization. Dr. Gautam Mukerjee, Associate Professor of Economics at the University
of Pittsburgh at Bradford, captures the essentials of globalization without getting bogged
down in high theory. The main reason that this handbook triumphs, is due to its simple
yet relative nature. It covers topics at both an introductory and an intermediate level, so it
benefits the novice and the experienced alike.
In the first few chapters, Mukerjee discusses the history and theoretical framework behind
globalization. I feel that these chapters are some of the best in the book because they
demonstrate how globalization has become so intertwined with economics, finance, politics
and socialization. The chapters lay out all of the fundamentals and vocabulary that one
needs to understand the concepts and then encourages its readers to dive deeper into their
analysis. Interestingly, Chapter 3 concludes with the Brexit scenario and the author paints
a depiction of a growing anti-globalism/pro-nationalism sentiment- which I couldn’t find
to be more fitting for us to study as we are faced with similar uncertainties concerning our
new Executive Administration here in the United States.
As a practitioner, the aspect that I truly appreciate about Economics of Globalization: A
Handbook is the text’s ability to work cross-functionally or cross-curriculum. As a professor
of finance, I’ll use this handbook with my students when we are covering the topics of
international finance, financial markets, economic systems, as well as financial scandals and
crises. I’ve already begun using this handbook as the primary text in one of my courses
(economic systems) and I plan to use it as a supplementary source in a few others. Specifically,
Mukerjee does a great job covering financialization in Chapter 6 where he investigates the
growing, risk-seeking nature of capital markets and international investment. Not surprising,
this often creates an exorbitant economic boom, which may or may not be followed by an
unpredictable yet devastating POP of the bubble!

Foreword

In all, I truly enjoyed this book. It is an easy read and I found it very easy to comprehend.
Mukerjee doesn’t get caught up in all of the scholarly references to economic theories and
studies that often leave undergraduates more confused than enlightened. It is also worthwhile
to note, that there are useful questions at the end of each chapter – which I prefer to use for
classroom discussions, but they could easily be assigned for homework as well. This handbook
couldn’t come at a better time, because much of the future is uncertain…are we at the
precipice of a worldwide retraction or is globalization on a course of exponential possibilities?

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

History of globalization

1	 HISTORY OF GLOBALIZATION
1.1	INTRODUCTION
Today our entire world appears to be an integrated network of markets that allows goods,
money and information to flow easily. This has created a remarkably broad range of choices
for global consumers.
Today it is just as easy to find a McDonald’s in Egypt or a KFC in Kuwait as a Japanese
sushi bar in a big city in the United States. While Photoshop online makes our snapshots
look amazing, they may also be shared with the rest of the world just as easily as e-books,
downloadable music and mobile apps may be circulated endlessly.
The three essential components of globalization are:
•	 Free trade in goods and services
•	 Integrated resource markets across nations
•	 Integrated financial (capital) markets
Although international trade is clearly a significant part of globalization, the latter involves
much more than may be readily apparent. For the idealists among us, globalization promises
economic freedom and prosperity for all, provided everyone is receptive to all the changes
that it brings.
While globalization permits our stores to be stocked with a great variety of wonderful
products from all over the world, businesses also enjoy expanding opportunities to access
resources in remote places. This not only means a ready availability of cutting-edge production
methods and new technologies but also large pools of savings that may be channeled into
profitable investments.
Think of the tremendous success of Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant that recently
went public by selling shares on the New York Stock Exchange. It turned out to be a
blockbuster share offering that raked in billions of dollars for the company.
Great advances in computers and telecommunications technology have set the tone for the
latest phase of globalization in the 21st century, as the whole world has begun to be shrinkwrapped as it were. The internet captures the spirit of it beautifully by:
•	 compressing our sense of time and space
•	 providing an enormous data highway for virtual goods in transit
•	 offering round-the-clock trading anywhere in the world

History of globalization

With the United States being a prominent player in the global marketplace and always ready
to weigh in as necessary to resolve trade conflicts, we shall use the U.S. as our vantage point
in our study of globalization.
In this chapter we shall learn about the historical origins of globalization and explore the
economic thinking that drives its dynamic. We shall then proceed to examine the relatively
recent phenomenon of hyperglobalization along with the intriguing concept of a weightless
economy and the complex challenges it presents in our lives.

1.2	 GLOBAL LIVING
It is hard to believe but a huge volume of the cut flowers that we buy every day and for
special occasions come from distant Colombia and Ecuador, where they are grown in massive
greenhouses. A lot of the fresh produce that are sold in the grocery stores all over the U.S.
also comes from nearby Mexico.
The most spectacular import by far are the great big shrimps at our local supermarkets;
they are flown in from India in giant refrigerated containers. Consider staple commodities
such as, sugar, coffee, chocolate, tea and bananas; these products travel enormous distances
to get to our cupboards. It is estimated that the contents of a single plate of food on the
typical American dinner table carry an average tag of about 1500 miles1.

History of globalization

At this point, we may say that there is a simple solution when it comes to foods. Why don’t
we simply turn to locally grown foods? But local production is not as simple as it sounds.
It is especially problematic because:
•	 Local production may be much more expensive than imports since the latest
production techniques may not be available
•	 The limited scale of local production automatically precludes large cost savings
•	 Local production cannot possibly offer the sheer variety that may be enjoyed by
trading through global markets
We may very well believe in organic foods and healthy eating but what if our food budget
alone eats up a big part of our paycheck? Then we will have less money left with which
to do the other things that we enjoy most. Food cannot be the only thing that makes life
enjoyable. So globalization offers an easy and convenient solution:
•	 Tap into efficient production methods using the most modern technology
•	 Build access to low cost resource markets around the globe
•	 Enlarge the scale of production which makes products cheaper
In the end, globalization offers us more value for our money along with a wider variety of
products which translate into a better standard of living.

1.3	 KEY NETWORKS
Today, the phenomenon of globalization is integral to our lives. This is not only evident
from the all-pervasive e-commerce but also the huge communications network made up
of smartphones, fax, email, Facebook and all the other modes of connectivity imaginable.
Take the internet as an example; apart from collapsing distances and offering communication
services efficiently, it is also a multi-dimensional tool that affects every aspect of our lives.
Here is an attractive list, of what the internet has on offer:
•

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

History of globalization

Given how the internet has opened up a brand new frontier of opportunities with tremendous
global potential, it is hardly surprising that most enterprising individuals and companies
waste little time in becoming an online presence. Without putting entire businesses or
services online one might fail to tap into the lucrative economies of scale and scope.
•	 Note: Economy of scale: as the scale of production gets bigger the average production
cost falls in tandem. Economy of scope suggests that with a broader selection of
products or services a firm can lower production costs
The ability to capture bigger markets through information technology not only improves the
profit picture of a globalized firm but helps with the health of the broader economy as well.
This is because expanding markets are expected to create more employment opportunities
thereby bringing about rising incomes and affordable living.

1.4	 ECONOMIC THINKING
Sometimes people think of globalization as a buzzword for the new millennium but it is
not so. The idea is as old as recorded history. Economists have long been fascinated with
the idea of globalization.
Ever since the Industrial Revolution from 1760s on, new manufacturing processes were
constantly changing the economic landscape. This meant not only steady improvements in
the average living standard but expanding markets all around the world.
There were three key processes underlining early globalization:
•	 Mechanization of production using steam power
•	 Advent of steamships and railroads
•	 Invention of the telegraph
In sum, the visible changes occurring in transportation and communications made all the
difference. By the early 19th century, sharp reductions in the cost of trade also meant that
markets needed to expand as fast as possible and preferably unencumbered by too many
government regulations.
The logic of these sharply changing processes of industry and commerce in the 1770s caught
the attention of Adam Smith, a professor of moral science in Glasgow. Smith was among
the first to realize that expanding commerce was the surest way to escape the daily grind
of primitive living conditions and bare minimum existence. His ideas were laid out in his
oft-quoted 1776 classic, The Wealth of Nations.

History of globalization

Smith illustrated the point by using the example of Native Americans who had been brought
into the trading circuit by European traders. This allowed an exotic assortment of animal
skins in the possession of the former to be traded for blankets, fire-arms and brandy made
many thousands of miles away.
Smith’s ideas on trade and commerce were reinforced further by David Ricardo, another
prominent political economist and a very successful financial speculator. Ricardo (1817)
introduced the idea of comparative advantage into the economic lexicon.
Since then economists have viewed trade to be closely tied to the notion of comparative
advantage.
•	 Note: comparative advantage is based on the idea that the resource cost ratio of
producing something varies across nations; this facilitates specialization and trade
Let’s take a simple example. Consider that the resource cost of producing 2 bicycles in
the U.S. is the same as that of producing 20 blue jeans; for China on the other hand, the
resource cost of manufacturing 2 bicycles is the same as producing 30 blue jeans.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

History of globalization

Since the resource cost ratio between bicycles and blue jeans stands at 1:10 in the U.S.
while it is 1:15 in China, the U.S. has a comparative advantage in making bicycles while
China has a similar advantage in making blue jeans. In this case it makes sense for the
U.S. to specialize in bicycle manufacture and leave blue jean production to China. This is
how trade permits specialization, thereby conserving precious resources in both countries.
At this point, it may be worthwhile to highlight the essential distinction between comparative
advantage and competitive advantage.
•	 Note: competitive advantage is all about capturing market shares from competitors
using a whole host of strategies that could extend from taking control of low cost
resources somewhere in the globe to bypassing environmental regulations
In effect, comparative advantage is geared to benefit both parties to a trade but competitive
advantage tends to benefit one party over another, with or without trade.
Both Smith and Ricardo were highly influential classical economists and their ideas
eventually led most major economies of the western world to relax import taxes and other
trade restrictions that had once stifled trade so as to favor very narrowly defined national
interests. None of the classical economists explicitly used the word globalization in their
learned treatises but the idea appears to have been foremost in their minds.
From a historical perspective, globalization has always depended on three important processes:
•	 Technological progress in both transportation and communication (i.e. falling cost)
•	 Elimination of barriers to trade (e.g. tariffs, quotas and other non-price barriers)
•	 Maintenance of a stable monetary unit of value (e.g. the gold standard)
As may be expected, nothing can spook global traders worse than an unstable currency.
This fear was more or less eliminated with the adoption of the gold standard among most
trading nations in the western world from the 1870s on.
•	 Note: Gold standard is a monetary system by which the value of a currency is set
in terms of a stated quantity of gold for which the currency may be exchanged.
For example, the U.S. gold standard was set after WWII at $1 = 1/35 oz. of gold;
this meant that the official price of gold was set at $35 for an ounce.
With the fear of arbitrary fluctuations in currency values thus dispelled, the road was clear
for a free movement of financial capital across national borders. This was tremendously
helpful in making globalization more feasible than ever before.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

History of globalization

Thus globalization can only thrive so long as there is a supportive institutional framework
which involves:
•	 Legal mechanisms for establishing property rights and the rules of fair exchange
•	 Policies for establishing fair standards for labor and the environment
•	 Stabilization policies for managing economic swings and preventing financial panics
While most economists are fully committed to the idea of free trade, there is always a
danger that the idea of globalization may be oversold. Often enough there is a lot of public
opposition to globalization due to justifiable concerns about protecting jobs and incomes
along with the long-term health of communities and environmental health2. These issues
cannot simply be ignored.
Understandably, everyone prefers a set of key institutions that can ensure a fair degree of
international cooperation and keep the integrated markets in goods, services and finance in
working order. If history is any indication, the slightest sign of weakness anywhere, be it
geopolitical uncertainty or fractured trade relations, globalization could easily unravel rather
quickly and with dire consequences.

1.5	 EARLY ORIGINS
Some argue that the origins of globalization may be traced all the way back to the early
civilizations of Sumer (modern day Iraq) and the Indus Valley (an area that overlaps India
and Pakistan) both of which existed in the third millennium BCE. By far the most famous
trade link of the ancient world was the Silk Road that connected China to ancient Europe
some two thousand years ago.
By the Hellenistic age, active trade links connecting the East and the West had been well
established. Such routes flourished during the period stretching between the death of
Alexander the Great in 323 BCE and the conquest of Egypt by Rome in 50 BCE.
Comforting though historical bits may be, the truth of the matter is, what passes for
globalization today is the result of a much more recent set of events:
•	 16th century: transportation costs began to drop sharply
•	 1760s: Industrial Revolution introduced steam power thereby further lowering the
cost of carrying people and goods to great distances
•	 1830s on: prices of goods and services along with the cost of travel began to come
within the reach of the average individual

1.6	 RECENT HISTORY
For most scholars, the recent history of globalization begins with 19th century British
Imperialism. The British had been enormously successful in globalizing financial capital
as they created a huge investment network around the globe with the help of a sizeable
economic base of colonies.
Thanks to the British, there emerged a massive world market, a powerful testimony to the
great magic of industrialization and commercialization that turned Great Britain into a global
powerhouse. The secret to that success is generally traced to what has come to be known
as triangular trade, involving Britain, her colonies and the global market place.
This is how it worked:
•	 Britain’s colonies served as cheap sources of raw material for feeding the manufacturing
mills back home
•	 The manufactured products from Britain were bound for the expanding global market
•	 Surplus products were dumped on the colonies at very agreeable terms

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

History of globalization

For British investors back home this was a full-proof formula for assuring growth and
prosperity. As production costs were effectively kept down and markets continued to
expand, profits could be raked in with careless abandon and the mother country became
tremendously rich.
This production-distribution arrangement was also a hugely transformative process not only
for the colonies but the home front as well. This was when the enclosure movement began
to fence up the village commons for private use, thereby displacing settled populations.
•	 Note: Enclosure movement: the process (prevalent in England in the 18th and 19th
centuries) by which land owned in common by all members of a village was taken
into private use through legal means. This benefited the aristocracy while creating
a steady stream of landless peasants who were eventually absorbed into factory
employment, thanks to the Industrial Revolution.
However, it would be a mistake to think that the enclosure approach to overhauling the
social structure is the stuff of old legends. Similar upheavals are still going on if you know
where to look.
From the farming communities in Central America all the way to China and India, there
are broad swathes of village life being gobbled up by global market forces. Like it or not,
people are regularly pushed out of their sleepy existence and dragged into the bright lights
of economic enterprise; it is often a gut-wrenching process of social upheaval, especially for
those caught on the wrong side of economic progress.
So globalization is a mixed bag at best; just as it promises economic advancement, it also is
a hugely transformative force that can drastically alter the lives and livelihoods of individuals
and change the entire structure of societies. As we shall see later, the changes not only
impact on human well-being but on the broader environment as well.
1.6.1	 STAGE I (1870S TO 1913)

With the industrial revolution gathering steam in the 19th century, there came about a
tremendous increase in world trade along with a significant amount of international economic
integration. The entire process was commanded by mighty Britannia, who ruled the waves
for another full century. This meant controlling all three essential pieces of globalization:
•	 technological progress
•	 financial capital flows
•	 trade in goods and services.

Historians consider the first stage of early modern globalization to be between the 1870s
and 1913. This was when spectacular things began to happen as fast linkages began to be
established between the Old World and the New World with products and financial capital
criss-crossing the continents at a very fast pace. Here are a few salient features of that period:
•	 Britain was the only big economy to maintain open trade policies for a considerable
length of time
•	 The imperial power of Britain achieved complete market integration as markets for
goods and services were linked up along with complex networks for money and
financial assets
•	 The U.S. protected itself with very steep tariffs on manufactured imports and these
continued throughout the century
•	 The onset of a recession in 1870s triggered tensions in Continental Europe
As it happens, European farmers had been hit especially hard by the recession of the 1870s
as the lowering of tariff barriers created an influx of cheap grains from the New World
which brought in sharply lower prices. Not unexpectedly, there was a sharp swing in public
opinion against globalization:
•	 farmers in Europe found common cause with businesses, seeking protection from
cheap foreign imports
•	 tariff barriers were quickly erected which translated into highly restrictive trading
practices
•	 cordial relations between nations quickly turned sour and war clouds began to
gather overhead.
In 1914, with the onset of World War I, the cherished framework of globalization came
completely undone. What ensued was a complete hiatus in global commerce that was to
continue even after World War I had ended in 1918. The prewar trading relations did not
fully for a very long while.
During the 1920s, a culture of mutual mistrust and suspicion had taken over the global
trading regime; this shrank markets even further and led the world into the throes of the
Great Depression. The economic malaise dragged on through the 1930s and eventually
culminated in World War II (1939–45). The situation did not reverse itself until well after
WWII had ended and not even then did globalization come roaring back.

History of globalization

1.6.2	 STAGE II: POST-WWII (1945–1971)

One of the key problems concerning globalization is that it runs the risk of pitching trade
policy against domestic policy goals. During the interwar period, the issue of trade and
market linkages became highly politicized as nationalist spirits soared high and most of the
affluent nations of the world looked inward.
However, as World War II drew to a close there was a renewed interest in finding a reasonable
balance between an open global economy and sensible domestic politics. Under the Marshall
Plan, the U.S. sought to help a severely demoralized Europe and Japan to rebuild by:
•	 reopening trade routes was seen as the surest path to economic success
•	 making available easy credit through the Marshall Plan
Preeminent British economist John Maynard Keynes helped to design a happy formula that
would help nations to:
•	 open shop once again and engage in global exchange
•	 give top priority to their domestic concerns regarding full employment, economic
growth, equity, social insurance and the welfare state.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

History of globalization

What emerged was the Bretton Woods model named after the New Hampshire resort town
where Keynes and the representatives from 44 nations had gathered for a conference in July
1944. The purpose of the meeting was to draft a completely new set of rules with which
to govern global trade.
The Bretton Woods conference ran on two very powerful themes:
•	 full economic restoration of war-ravaged Great Britain
•	 allow for the advancement of American commerce and investment
Thus America’s position as a global economic power was assured as was the establishment
of the U.S. dollar as an international reserve currency backed by gold.
•	 Note: International reserve currency refers to money that is readily acceptable in
global trade; modern examples are the U.S. dollar, the U.K. pound, the euro and
the Japanese yen.
The Bretton Woods agreement was a brilliant piece of institutional engineering that equipped
the world economy with trading rules that could be set entirely by international organizations.
For the most part, Bretton Woods was powered by the idea of multilateralism involving
all trading nations. The aim was to:
•	 promote multilateral trade agreements among nations in the interest of enhancing
global trade
•	 create a giant tariff-free zone within which all participants may equally share without
fear of sudden market collapse
Three key institutions were charged with overseeing the globalization dynamic:
•	 The International Monetary Fund (IMF): intended to ensure monetary stability
and currency values.
•	 The World Bank: designed to address the development needs of aspiring market
economies.
•	 A General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT): an international forum
designed to help dismantle the old import restrictions from the 1930s and establish
new rules for fair trade.

The system proved to be enormously successful as global trade returned to a fast clip and
proceeded to double in volume just about every decade. For the next three decades the
Bretton Woods system proved to be very effective in steering the world economy toward
complete restoration, thereby promising lasting growth and prosperity.
1.6.3	 AN UNRAVELING

Tragically, nothing good lasts forever and the Bretton Woods system was no exception. As
it happens, free trade and exchange depend on maintaining balanced trade between nations.
This means that nations cannot enjoy trade surpluses endlessly while their trading partners
are saddled with mounting trade deficits.
•	 A trade surplus happens when the exports of a nation (what it sells to other
nations) exceeds its imports (what it buys from elsewhere)
•	 It is impossible to have a trade surplus without a corresponding trade deficit
(imports > exports) elsewhere in an interconnected global market.
The most current example is China’s ongoing trade surplus with the U.S. which has meant
a widening trade deficit for the latter. So long as the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank can smooth out the wrinkles, all is well. However, any time a nation refuses
to part with its trade surplus, there is likely to be trouble.
This is exactly what began to happen, starting in the mid-1960s. By then the industrial
and commercial stature of the United Kingdom, Europe and Japan had been restored to
pre-WWII levels. For the U.S. this translated into:
•	
•	
•	
•

growing trade deficit (i.e. imports greater than exports)
net outflow of U.S. dollars as the export of dollars exceeded imports
demand from trading partners to convert U.S. dollars into gold
steady drain in U.S. gold reserves

As a result the U.S. faced an immediate imperative to address the value of the dollar since
an insufficient gold reserve meant that the dollar would have to be devalued. This meant
two clear choices:
•	 Make the dollar less abundant in global exchange which would mean a corresponding
scaling back of the domestic economy given that money is the life blood of a
market economy
•	 Suspend the conversion of dollars into gold with immediate effect so as to stop the
rapid depletion of U.S. gold reserves.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

History of globalization

The Nixon government chose to abandon the gold standard in 1971 and made the dollar
into a floating currency. Henceforth, the value of the U.S. dollar would be determined by
the rules of supply and demand.
•	 Note: the value of a floating currency is determined the forces of demand and
supply in the global market. Thus a country’s trade deficit (surplus) would cause
the value of its currency to fall (rise) in global exchange. In effect, the burden of
correcting a trade imbalance falls on the currency.
Although globally unpopular, this unilateral move by the U.S. to abandon the gold standard
created considerable legroom to meet her ongoing trade shortfall. Henceforth a trade deficit
could simply be paid for by issuing more dollars.
Unfortunately, that easy resolution came to be rudely interrupted in 1973 by an oil embargo
(i.e. a steep cutback in oil supply) orchestrated by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC).

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

History of globalization

Since oil supplies are crucially linked to food production, travel, transportation, homeheating and the manufacture of plastic containers all the way to making printing ink and
synthetic fibers, the result was:
•	 a runaway inflation in the U.S. for which the country was not prepared
•	 a steep increase in production costs leading to rising unemployment
Stagflation is a term that economists use to refer to an undesirable combination of
unemployment and inflation. This mix is widely dreaded for it defies all conventional
policy fixes.
The Nixon government tried desperately to contain the growing malaise by imposing tight
price controls but that simply made things worse. What emerged were long lines at gas
stations as a beleaguered nation tried to cope with the scarcity of oil through strict rationing.
Ultimately, it was up to the Federal Reserve to take effective steps. This meant slaying the
inflation dragon through steep cuts in the money supply. This quickly raised interest rates
while the unemployment rate also reached a high point not seen since the Great Depression.
Eventually calm returned, but the Bretton Woods model had to be scrapped completely.
We might say that the most prominent casualty of the stagflationary 1970s was the Bretton
Woods system.
1.6.4	 STAGE III: 1980S ON

Looking back, the 1945–73 period was enormously successful as economic growth continued
virtually uninterrupted. It is often referred to as the golden age of globalization during
which a wide variety of market-based economies flourished. It was a period that witnessed:
•	 remarkable advances in the processes of industrialization
•	 a healthy amount of global inflation that kept profits high
•	 stable monetary value secured by the U.S. dollar
Through it all, the United States emerged as a shining example of free market economics
that most other developed and developing nations could only hope to emulate. That
stellar image lost some of its luster as the gold standard was dismantled in 1971 but most
global currencies continued to be pegged to the U.S. dollar as a prominent international
reserve currency.

•	 Note: Dollar peg means that the exchange rate between a currency and the dollar is
artificially fixed so that the two currencies will move in tandem in global exchange.
This calls for active currency management.
Not surprisingly, the convenience of a dollar peg allowed trade imbalances to continue but
these were no longer viewed as a serious threat to economic survival.
In general, the value of a currency depends on:
•	 the state of a nation’s economic health as measured by inflation and growth prospects
•	 the extent to which financial capital can easily move in and out of a country
•	 the readiness of the national government to defend the value of the currency
All of these factors are important in driving global investor sentiments as well. As it is best
not to spook these important players for fear of doing serious damage to a currency and
an economy, it is best to manage a currency sensibly.
For the most part, this means that when its value rises in global exchange, more of that
currency must be released by the issuing country’s central bank so as to bring its value down.
This may be accomplished by
•	 exchanging the currency for an international reserve currency (e.g. U.S. dollar or
the British pound)
•	 buying back the currency by drawing down gold reserves
Exactly the opposite set of moves are needed to strengthen a currency.
At any rate, by the mid-seventies, the countries that could not see their currencies to be
completely at the mercy of global capital markets looked for a safer alternative. For the
nations in Europe this meant:
•	 developing a new exchange rate regime to coordinate currency value with trade flows
•	 developing strategies to promote economic stability for the entire European
trading zone
This led to the establishment of the European Currency Union which eventually created
the euro as the official currency for 18 countries in the eurozone.

Thus in many ways the economic unraveling threatened by the stagflationary seventies also
ushered in a new phase of globalization in the 1980s. Policymakers everywhere realized that
there is always a stiff tradeoff between domestic autonomy and the value of one’s currency
in international exchange but there were definite payoffs in playing the global market.
As new technologies began to come on board by the early 1980s, the mechanics of globalization
received an added boost. This was the onset of the information age that eventually came to
be known as the ICT revolution
•	 Note: ICT stands for a very potent combination of the internet, computers and
telecommunications. Some think of it as a second Industrial Revolution that has
undoubtedly changed the world for ever.
Somewhat fortuitously, the U.S. government in the early 1980s had already begun to
establish national supercomputing centers all over the country. This helped pave the road
for commercial internet service providers who were jockeying for the opportunity to create
newer channels of commerce.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

History of globalization

With the new computer-based information technologies, globalized enterprise was revolutionized.
This happened through:
•	 The establishment of 24 hour financial capital markets
•	 A proliferation of multinational companies (MNC)
•	 A push for further liberalization of capital controls to open up capital market
around the world
It was a definitive shift in the dynamics of globalization that received another boost when:
•	 The Berlin Wall came down in 1989
•	 Markets in Eastern Europe opened up to global trade in late 1989
•	 The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991

1.7	HYPERGLOBALIZATION
On the face of it, the 1980s was a huge achievement in global market-building but it also
called for a synchronization of efforts on all fronts which for the most part meant cutting
down cumbersome government regulations that not too long ago controlled from airfares
to telephone charges to the interest rates offered on bank deposits.
Thus hyperglobalization came to stand for a thorough redesigning of the domestic policies
of nations according to a pretty standard formula sheet3:
•	 Paring down domestic budget deficits
•	 Keeping domestic inflation under control
•	 Scaling back social welfare programs
This meant a complete redesign and overhaul of structure of globalization, made official
with the inauguration of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995.
In many ways hyperglobalization became a prominent trademark of the new millennium
as ongoing changes in information and communication technologies brought about further
product and process innovations in global market economies.
This meant a complete reorientation in macroeconomic thinking as:
•	 entire nations felt compelled to play up to the interests of MNCs
•	 financial capital markets quickly rose to dominate global trade negotiations
•	 inevitable social dislocations continued to be downplayed

Undeniably, putting globalization into overdrive generated economic stresses and social
disruptions that raised a few serious concerns about:
•	 public health (e.g. a salmonella scare in 2008 regarding Mexican tomatoes)
•	 public safety and security (e.g. heightened airline passenger and cargo security in
recent years)
•	 security of property rights, especially, intellectual property rights (e.g. the advent
of fake Apple stores in China in 2011)
While it may be easy to say that in the long haul all of these problems would work
themselves out, there is always a danger that the entire globalization framework could also
come unhinged, quite unexpectedly, thereby producing many undesirable consequences that
may be difficult to contain.

1.8	 WEIGHTLESS ECONOMY
The label “weightless economy”4 appropriately describes a world ruled by ICT. It suggests a
knowledge-based economy that is full to the brim with products that are completely made
up of digital bits and bytes.
In general, the popular information (weightless) products possess several attractive features:
•	 incredible lightness of content
•	 infinite expandability in the sense that they may be copied freely without exhausting
the original in any way
•	 collapsibility of distance in the sense that information products may be delivered
over great distances without being destroyed
•	 collapsibility of time as information products could be transmitted instantaneously
So in our weightless economy the products are not only lighter but some of them are
completely virtual as well. Think of the huge variety of phone apps that are at our finger
tips. That’s only one aspect of our engagement in:
•	 virtual exchange in cyber space
•	 making virtual payments as necessary
•	 using virtual money (e.g. bitcoins that are a software-based online payment system)
Of course the internet is a central part of the weightless dynamic. It provides an excellent
medium for delivering computer software, new media, video entertainment, healthcare
advice, educational services, pricing and supply data as well as back-office services over very
large distances around the globe almost instantaneously.

Also, thanks to ICT, businesses can now get by with sharply reduced inventories as they can
also manage their supply chains and the distribution channels much better than ever before.
Nowhere is this more obvious than in the areas of banking and investment. In a highly
networked world, banks and other financial institutions can:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

advertise and promote their newest products and services
carry out orders to sell, buy, trade and manage financial assets
personalize their services to best address the special needs of clients
conduct all manner of financial transactions in a timely fashion
monitor changes in the financial world so as to devise effective strategies

Notice how bill payment has so easily come online with such innovations as PayPal and
Amazon Payments. Today, most major credit card transactions are conducted on line which
has made life a lot easier for those who have to move fast between places and constantly
think of new strategies of adaptation.

Quite justifiably, globalization is often credited with promoting huge networks of services
that include:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

telecommunications
insurance
accounting
banking and other financial services
social networking

These days, most people go through E-trade almost as a matter of routine and these trades
have a huge impact when it comes to buying and selling financial assets or settling claims
as we shall see in a later chapter.

1.9	 BUSINESS DEALS
Through the established global networks our businesses can become a massive global presence.
This is because a huge computerized network helps to
•	 share information collected from all over the globe
•	 act instantly on price signals and other market shifts
Currently, Goldman Sachs, a huge investment bank based nominally in the U.S. operates
out of 170 locations in more than 90 cities across 30 countries. This reflects the fact that
the enormously popular and profitable sector of financial portfolio management now requires
a global presence.
Most particularly, the pension funds and mutual funds on which depends the economic
security of nearly 60% of all American households now feel obligated to have a global reach
and try to address the service needs of bigger segments of the global citizenry.
The same may be said about Amazon.com which continues to meet our everyday shopping
needs so seamlessly. It is a sobering thought that the company is counted among one of the
top ten global retailers by sales5. In fact, global strategizing, which means devising clever
schemes to capture a bigger market share, happens to be the key to Amazon’s continued success.
Of course this also means that the web-retailer has to be ever so vigilant about
•	 constantly changing customer preferences
•	 newer ways to satisfy customer needs
•	 new product and process innovations cropping up

Perhaps no business enjoys so sizeable a global footprint as the fast food icon, McDonald’s.
Today the company operates in more than 100 countries, lending its brand to more than
80% of the restaurants that are owned and operated by independent local business people.
As wonderful as the global business opportunities sound, when it comes to economic
development, not every nation on earth can get onto the global bandwagon using information
technology. This is because they often lack:
•	 a large pool of well-educated and highly skilled labor
•	 a vital institutional network that protect property rights and legality of action
•	 stable governments that are favorably disposed toward a market-based economy
It is only with this kind of supportive institutional base that nations can take advantage of
the information revolution and open up to global markets. This explains the tremendous
success of the Asian Tigers, a moniker for a select group made up of Singapore, Hong
Kong, South Korea and Taiwan.
Lately, global attention has shifted to the BRICS consortium of nations: Brazil, Russia,
India, China and South Africa. These nations are generally credited with having fast rates
of growth and fairly stable governments that permit fruitful connections with steadily
expanding global markets.

1.10	 NEW CHALLENGES
Thanks to information technology, when it comes to virtual products, the marginal cost of
production is close to zero. In other words, it costs virtually nothing to manufacture a virtual
product that can be consumed instantaneously without any consideration of time or space.
The numerous apps on our smart phones or all the music that we can easily download are
perfect examples. However, the flip side of zero marginal cost, if we follow the basic rules
of economics, must mean zero price. In a fiercely competitive global environment it could
hardly be otherwise.
•	 Note: In economics a competitive market solution occurs whenever the marginal
cost of a product equals its competitive market price.
This however presents a problem since there can be no incentive for inventing or innovating
in a virtual product the market price for which is near zero. This is where institutional factors
take on considerable importance which also means a bigger role for the government to play.

Most pressingly there is a need to protect cherished enterprise from marauders around the
globe. Hence a growing need for:
•	 A legal structure for establishing property rights, especially, intellectual property
rights by way of patents, copyrights and trademarks
•	 Regulating market access through licensing and protecting established domains
•	 Generous research funding to foster new inventions and innovations
•	 Ensuring adequate protection to individuals and businesses against unfair trading
practices and unwanted incursions into personal or financial databases
Looking over the history of the last century, there can be no doubt that the merits of the
globalization game depend on how it is played. The biggest challenge by far is to strike a
reasonable balance between:
•	 Ensuring technological progress that impacts on product and process innovations
•	 Eliminating trade barriers by way of tariffs, quotas and other restrictions
•	 Maintaining a stable monetary value to minimize investor uncertainty

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

History of globalization

In effect, so long as information technology continues to make our daily tasks easier by
permitting faster dissemination of information and making all daily exchanges cheaper and
easier, there is an ongoing need for the government to get involved and stay involved, either
directly or indirectly.
Letting up on any one of these might bring globalization to an abrupt halt. As we saw
earlier, the Bretton Woods system could only liberalize trade after putting capital controls
in place and reestablishing the gold standard so as to ensure monetary stability.
In contrast, during the 1980s and 1990s there was a great emphasis on liberalizing both
trade and capital flows with more or less free floating exchanges all around. This makes the
latest phase of globalization most challenging since:
•	 the high-income countries are better able to play global markets to their own
advantage
•	 it is tougher for the developing countries to meet the demands of global competition
•	 the directives from IMF, the World Bank and the WTO often conflict with the
domestic priorities of nations

1.11	 MIXED PICTURE
Today very few can deny that consumers are one of the most clear beneficiaries of globalization.
This is because globalization allows:
•	
•	
•	
•	

a great selection of products from all over the globe
affordable prices and ease of comparison shopping
online service for customers and accounts management
online payments and online banking

It is true that a cheapening of the essential commodities for daily living is of tremendous
benefit to us but since wage is also a price, this could also mean shrinking paychecks and
diminished job prospects for some.
This makes globalization a mixed picture at best, a subject that will be taken up again in
later chapters. For now it is sufficient to note that not all areas within an economy are
totally impervious to the risk and uncertainty fueled by globalization.
Not surprisingly, despite singing the glories of free trade, even the most affluent countries
continue to protect their labor-intensive resource-processing and agricultural sectors against
the influx of cheaper imports. Unfortunately, these bits of protectionism hurt the developing
nations that rely on the export of agricultural and natural resources as a viable path to
economic development.

In other words, free trade is not such an easy idea to embrace and globalization has its own
set of complexities. Nothing can make this clearer than one of the most contentious areas
concerning liberal trade that happens to be human migration.
Looking around, immigration continues to be a hot-button issue in most elections in the
developed world. This is also why most high-income countries are also grappling with tight
controls on the inflow of immigrants. In recent history, human migration has gone through
noticeable changes; this again has had a lot to do with falling transportation costs, national
policy swings and geopolitical stability. Consider this:
•	 All through the 19th century until the eve of World War I, the volume of migration
between continents increased tremendously
•	 Between 1914 and 1950 migration was sharply cut back due to restrictive immigration
policies and the onset of two World Wars and a global depression
•	 From 1950 to 2000 a steep fall in transportation costs caused migrant flows to
rise once again
What complicates matters is that once we introduce the human element to the globalization
mix then it is not so easy to see unadulterated benefits everywhere. Just as cheap imports
tend to depress prices by increasing competition, a surge of immigrants could easily depress
domestic wages thereby dimming the job prospects of a lot of people.
This is one of the reasons that there is a global drift toward cultivating a regional consciousness.
As late as 2013, the BRICS nations formed their own development bank. It was a deliberate
move to counter the power and influence of the IMF, the World Bank and the WTO. There
is also some talk about dislodging the U.S. dollar from its global reserve currency status.
Thus it is safe to say that the globalization dynamics entails the creation of special institutional
arrangements to better suit particular needs and interests not only of the developed world
but that of the emerging nations as well. It is quite possible that we may be heading toward
another Bretton Woods type moment but as to that, only time will tell.

Presumably, the more we can produce and by using fewer resources, the better off we should
be in the long run, provided of course we can trade freely. That is the secret to wealth
creation according to the father of economics, Adam Smith, as he is commonly understood.
Thus a fruitful combination of technological progress and free markets is widely seen to be a
sure formula for economic well-being. Margaret Thatcher, the prime minister of the United
Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 was an avid supporter of free markets and globalization; she
is famously credited for promoting the acronym TINA (there is no alternative).
What passes for globalization today, is made up of many of the desirable traits that make
up free market economics:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Technological progress causing the cost of transportation and communication to fall
industrial restructuring triggered by market-oriented reforms across countries
Elimination of trade barriers and active promotion of free trade
Growth in the global reach of multinational corporations (MNC)
Globalization of finance and financialization of national economies

As may be seen, the list above covers much more than what had been noted earlier. In this
chapter we shall dig a bit deeper into the nature of trade, the evolution of global trade
agreements, the cost of trade, the makeup of currency markets and the nature of capital
flows, concluding with the overarching question of economic freedom.

2.2	 IMPORTANCE OF TRADE
Once we accept technological progress as the backbone of economic advancement, globalization
follows as a logical extension. This is because the only way for technological progress to
be fully adopted for economic gain is through market expansion and this is made possible
through trade.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Structure of Globalization

It is widely believed that an increase in the ratio of the volume of trade of a country
to its GDP increases its per capita income. According to the Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), nations that are relatively open to trade tend on
average to grow much faster than those who are reluctant about opening up fully to trade1.
The OECD is a choice club of prosperous market economies that are also functioning
democracies.
Note: Established in 1961. The OECD is an exclusive group of 34 prosperous nations
around the world that regularly turn to each other to identify problems and discuss
solutions. The member nations have to be operational democracies and have marketbased economies.
Apart from serving as a unique forum for airing the shared concerns of nations that are
exposed to the changing economic currents all over the globe, the OECD is also an excellent
source of economic statistics that enables us to gauge the health of the global economy.
Following Smith’s impeccable logic, the prosperity of a nation depends on trade and both
are intimately tied to the ideas of:
•	 Division of labor and productivity
•	 Specialization and efficiency
Smith had pointed out long ago that so long as each one of us specializes in what we do
best, all of us can be more productive and through free exchange we can all be better off.
The same logic applies to international trade as well so that allowing nations to specialize
in whatever they can produce best and then engaging in free trade must make all better off.
If we believe that a society needs to improve the overall productive power in order to raise
the average standard of living, then there is no alternative but harness most of the early
breakthroughs in technology to profitable production through expanding markets.
Even a casual comparison of the lifestyle of the average person in an OECD nation with
that of a person in the developing world should convince us of the logic of that simple
formula. The member nations of OECD have been enormously successful in generating
very high standards of living for the best part of their citizenry and much of it has to do
with their active participation in trade.

According to a report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD), the world merchandise trade volume has grown by about 50% since 2000,
even after allowing for the dip caused by the financial crisis of 2008 that threatened to
bring down the entire global economy2.
At any rate, what is most striking about the developments since the last crisis:
•	 The emerging market economies on the path of development happened to gain the
most from the post-crisis growth spurt; this is most visible in their merchandise
exports which has increased more than 100 percent since the crisis outbreak.
•	 The merchandise export volume of most advanced economies has remained relatively
flat since the last crisis.
Taken altogether, it is as if the advanced economies have reached a point of saturation in
terms of both production and trading while the advancing economies are nimble enough
to reap the biggest gains offered by the expanding global markets.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Structure of Globalization

We should normally expect the advanced nations to be better positioned in terms of buying
power and market size to take advantage of any opportunities that crop up in global trading
before any of their emerging market counterparts but that has not been the case.
This contrasting picture is not too difficult to explain considering that:
•	 the exports of the advanced economies tend to be very technology-intensive which
makes them somewhat pricey and of limited appeal in global markets.
•	 the exports of the emerging markets are simpler manufactured goods mostly using
less complex technology which makes them cheaper.
Consequently, when nations come out of an economic slump the cheaper goods tend to
be snapped up earlier and faster than the more expensive goods. The only exceptions are:
•	 mineral resources (e.g. bauxite for aluminum and cobalt for aircraft engines)
•	 basic staples (e.g. cereals and sugar)
These are the primary exports of many very poor countries which explains why they tend
to benefit less when markets expand but are hurt more when global markets shrink.
Back in 1981 the European Union had the highest share in both the total global output of
goods and services and world exports. By comparison, China’s share in world exports and
global GDP was miniscule. All that changed with the tearing down of the Berlin Wall in
1989 as both global merchandise exports and imports moved onto a faster clip.
By the end of the last century, China had successfully doubled her share of global exports
whereas developing Africa, trading mostly in natural resources and staples, faced a steep
loss in its share of world exports which plunged even further by 2010.
Today the U.S. happens to have a smaller share of world exports compared to the European
Union which continues to enjoy a lion’s share of the global markets. Evidently, the trading
positions of nations are not fixed on world charts so that today’s leader could very well
trail behind the competitors tomorrow. This explains why most nations are forever on the
lookout for newer opportunities in the global circuit.

2.3	 GATT TO WTO
As we have seen earlier, globalization is neither a smooth nor a continuous process. It was
completely suspended in the period between the two world wars. With the conclusion of
World War II in 1945, the United States took up the charge of reviving globalization.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

As a dominant player on the global scene with both the military power and economic resources
to match, it was only logical that the U.S. should try to revitalize the global economy. This
was the best way to allow the other industrial powers to regain their economic footing and
return promptly to prosperity.
However, the pre-war memories being fresh in the minds of the architects of reconstruction,
every effort was made not to make global markets a free-for-all for the powerful players.
What emerged from the urgent discussions at government levels was the General Agreement
to Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
GATT originally had 23 signatories and was negotiated at the United Nations; it was passed
in 1947 and implemented in 1948. It proved to be an indispensable forum for:
•	 setting global trade back on track to fast recovery from the devastation of war
•	 bringing all the players onto a system of useful dialog to synchronize policies
•	 providing a platform for useful negotiations
Globalization was thus recreated and set on a new and more sensible course with a whole
bunch of institutional safeguards put in place. As was seen in the previous chapter, the
combination of GATT and Bretton Woods freed up trade and the scheme worked beautifully
for most of the post-WWII years until about the early 1970s.
Here it is worthwhile to recall that with Bretton Woods establishing the gold standard in
1944, global trade had been given the solid foundation of a stable monetary unit. Thus
there was considerable credibility lent to global trading.
Not surprisingly, when the U.S. abruptly went off the gold standard in the 1970s, it introduced
considerable uncertainty all around. However, given the overall economic strength of the
U.S., the dollar continued to serve as a premier international reserve currency in terms of
which global trade could continue uninterrupted.
Over the subsequent decades, global trade began to outgrow the operational bounds set by
GATT so that there was growing support for redrawing the rules of trade. This led to the
creation of the World Trade Organization.
Note: The World Trade Organization (WTO) was created in 1995 as an enlarged version
of GATT with the intention of regularizing global trade and enforcing the agreed upon
rules of free trade. As of June 2014 WTO had 160 members.

2.4	 TRADING COSTS
International trading volumes are very sensitive to fluctuations in transportation costs.
As we have seen earlier, falling transport costs in the century or so before World War II
made possible economic integration within and between countries; most of the decline in
cost was due in large measure to the large infrastructure investments and breakthroughs in
transport technology.
A 2009 report from the World Bank makes two interesting observations3:
•	 A 10% increase in trade costs tends to reduce trade volumes by 20%.
•	 A larger trade volume brings down unit transportation costs.
China is the best example of both findings. China’s enormous trade volume (bulk shipping)
is a significant reason for low unit transportation costs. This creates its own virtuous circle:
•	 Scale economies in transport lead to falling unit transport costs.
•	 Falling transportation costs lead to increased trade volume.
•	 Cost advantage encourages other countries to move production to China.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Structure of Globalization

It is estimated that by the mid-1970s, the overseas transport costs were a fraction of what
they had once been in 1900. In terms of falling transportation costs alone, globalization
may be looked at in terms of two distinct waves:
•	 First wave between 1840 and World War I is considered conventional as it relied
on little more than comparative advantage
•	 Second wave, from 1950 on was driven by economies of scale and product
differentiation
The “conventional” wave witnessed improvements in technology that created ever-newer modes
of profitable transport of people and goods. This transportation revolution advanced through:
•	 the use of canals and waterways in Europe and the Americas (1750s to 1900)
•	 the appearance of the steamship in the early 1800s
•	 the advent of railways in England in the 1830s.
Initially, the increased speed and reliability of service helped the prices for both manufactured
and agricultural goods to converge. Internationally, steamships lowered maritime transport costs
and in combination with all the other innovation in transportations made large scale trade
possible (e.g. British trading machinery for Indian tea, Argentine beef and Australian wool).
The second wave suggested a new trading pattern. It began after 1950 when transport
costs fell even further so that even small differences in products and tastes allowed trade
between similar countries in Europe and North America. In contrast with the first wave,
the second was driven more by economies of scale and product differentiation rather than
simply differences in resource endowments.
With the arrival of the jet engine, air transport costs came down rather quickly from the
mid-1950s to the early 1970s. What helped tremendously was the lifting of government
regulation from trucking and rail in the 1970s and the deregulation of maritime rates in 1984.
Not surprisingly, freight costs halved again since the mid-1970s. This was driven by:
•	
•	
•	
•	

increased investments in transport infrastructure
development of better ways for capacity use
vast improvements in road and air transport
containerization revolution in maritime transport

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Structure of Globalization

Not surprisingly, container lines have continued to build larger and larger ships, thereby
generating further scale advantages that have driven down the transport cost per unit of cargo.
By 2000 the cost of ocean shipping came down to a fraction of what it was in 1930 while
the advent of the jet engine drove air freight costs down sharply since the mid-1950s to the
1970s. It is estimated that between 1955 and 2004, there was more than a 90% reduction
in air freight prices per ton-kilometer (see World Bank 2009).
Lately, the major cost declines in all modes of transport have allowed the ship-railroad-truck
channel of cargo transmission to become smooth and continuous with virtually no time wasted
in transfers or delays. This is because there are no longer significant gaps between switching
transportation modes from ship to rail to trucks or moving cargo in the reverse direction.

2.5	 FAVORABLE WINDS
The great strides in technology aside, the spectacular fall in transport costs has been possible
very substantially due to:
•	 significant transport reforms (e.g. integrating rules across modes of transport)
•	 elimination of trade barriers (e.g. tariffs and quotas)
On the heels of it came the digital revolution that unleashed a speed of transmission and
communication not imaginable even a short time ago. It effectively shrank the world with
freer and faster flows of information, driving a steep fall in communication costs. As a result
there have been great advances in:
•	 fragmenting production processes so that not everything has to be done in one place
•	 outsourcing and offshoring of intermediate goods production contributing to great
cost-saving innovations
A good example is a PC made in America for which the motherboard and circuit board
may have come from China. This produces huge benefits by way of specialization and scale
economies along with affordable prices for the consumer.
Furthermore, with a fall in telecommunications costs large cities in the U.S. and Europe
started outsourcing accounting services and call center facilities to smaller cities in Europe
and North America. With further decreases in the telecomm costs, the offshoring orbit
extended from the West to cities in distant India and the Philippines.

As a result, the last three decades have seen tremendous growth in intraindustry trade.
Note: Intraindustry trade occurs when the same type of good is exported from a country
as well as imported into it
Consider for instance cars being exported as well as imported. The same applies to
telecommunications equipment, computers and textiles as well. By far the simplest examples
are Samsung, Motorola and Nokia phones that involve multipoint production and assembly
around the globe; the same may also be said about TV remotes and textile products.
Intraindustry trade now accounts for more than half of all global trade. This has gone up
for all types of goods and services:
•	 primary goods e.g. oil and natural gas
•	 intermediate goods e.g. auto parts and computer help-lines
•	 final goods e.g. food and beverages

Note that if countries could only trade in final goods or finished products then international
living standards could not converge very fast. On the other hand, when trade involves
production inputs or intermediate goods then the potential for specialization and trade
increases significantly thereby giving a further boost to the virtuous circle of globalization.

2.6	 CAPITAL FLOWS
So much for global merchandise trade. Let’s now turn to the next important bit: private
financial capital flows. As luck would have it, this important dimension of globalization is
very often obscured by much animated talk about global trading volumes.
However, in terms of size alone, financial capital flows are generally much bigger than
merchandise trade.
The following are the essential aspects of capital flows:
•	
•	
•	
•	

Commercial loans involving banks and large organizations
Foreign direct investment (FDI)
Foreign portfolio investment (FPI)
Official capital flows between nations

As it happens, economic development is an unwritten but prominent goal of globalization.
This is because economists believe that the population-rich but capital-poor countries of the
world could easily set themselves on the path of economic growth and development if they
received a little help from foreign investors who have financial capital to spare.
Until the 1980s, commercial loans going to companies and the governments of developing
countries were the most common kind of foreign investment. Since then, FDI and FPI
have been much more common and have become an integral part of globalization. These
are mostly private investments that do not have the backing of governments.
More encouragingly, FDI involves a long-term relationship between investors residing in
one country and the development plan being drafted in another country. The arrangement
is supposed to be mutually beneficial in the sense that:
•	 The receiver nation does not have to rely on local funds which may be insufficient
or impeded by the absence of a well-developed capital market
•	 Receiver nation enjoys the benefits of development in a cost-effective way
•	 The donor nation receives handsome returns on the invested funds.

By comparison, foreign portfolio investments (FPI) mostly consist of stocks and bonds
issued in one country that are made available to citizens in other countries.
•	 Note: A stock or equity is a share issued by a company that suggests part ownership;
stocks pay a share of profits called dividends
•	 Note: A bond or security are a form of debt (also called debt instruments) that earn
interest. Bonds are essentially IOUs issued by the borrower, usually a corporation
or a government, who are obligated to pay interest.
When a company goes belly up, bond holders have to be paid first before stock holders can
claim any value on their stock holdings. In effect, one’s shares in a company are subordinate
to the debt owed by the firm.
Given that a whole bunch of stocks and bonds could be pooled into marketable securities
that are claims on a predicable stream of income over time brings in a maddeningly complex
world of finance. This leads to clever financial strategizing involving the packaging, promotion
and selling of financial assets around the globe.
Thanks to the advent of fast computers, the art of creating layered claims on income-generating
assets has become sort of routine. The claims created on pooled assets (e.g. home mortgages,
student loans etc.) are called derivatives which are freely traded in global markets and at
last call commanded more than $700 trillion which is roughly ten times the global GDP4.
•	 Note: Financial derivative is a contract between two or more parties the value of
which is determined by underlying assets that may be stocks, bonds, commodities
or currencies. Most of these contracts are backed by high levels of debt.
In effect, enormous sums of money are constantly on the move around the globe trading
claims on intangible assets in a weightless world ruled by information technology. However,
this also means that any letdown in investor expectations, no matter how slight, in one
part of the world could easily send tremors far away and that also with tremendous speed.
Of course there are also many financial transactions not covered by direct investment or
portfolio investment but they could still have sizeable impact on the capital flows between
nations. Collectively these make up financial globalization which over the past three decades
has grown at a much faster pace than trade globalization.

•	 Note: Financialization is the linking up of the markets for financial assets across
nations which offers lucrative returns for investors as well as for speculative capital.
It helps domestic borrowers to find international lenders and opens up access to
opportunities for investment overseas.
Financialization gathered momentum ever since financial deregulation took hold throughout
the 1980s. By the early 1990s, private capital flows from the developed countries started
to reach the shores of the developing nations. Looking back, this occurred in two strong
waves, demarcated also by two very significant financial crises:
•	 First was the emerging market crises of the late 1990s that were linked to a Thai
baht crisis
•	 Second, the global financial crisis of 2008 which originated in the U.S. and proved
to be comparable in potency to the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Interestingly enough, while the developed economies have been pioneers in financial
integration the developing countries have taken a long time to warm up to the idea. There
are still a lot of global players who are a bit reluctant to take the plunge.

The most famous example is China who, despite the massive size and trading prominence,
continues to have controls in place that carefully regulate the capital flows into and out
of the country. This reticence is understandable in view of the Asian financial crisis of the
late 1990s.
The Thai baht crisis in 1997 struck when international banks and private investors decided
to pull out of the Southeast Asian market all of a sudden. As a result, the baht, the currency
of Thailand, took a sharp nose-dive pulling down other currencies of neighboring countries
with it.
In contrast, the financial crisis of 2008 centered around mortgage-based assets, the prices
of which collapsed all of a sudden as the housing bubble that supported it popped quite
unexpectedly. This caused credit lines around the world to freeze up, threatening a global
economic meltdown.

2.7	 CURRENCY MARKETS
There happens to be a whole another dimension to financialization than what has been
considered thus far. This involves the foreign exchange markets, the scale and scope of
which is simply mind-numbing.
For instance, between the 1970s and the 1980s, the ratio of foreign exchange market
turnover to merchandise exports jumped from the teens to about 50. Since then that ratio
has doubled again and stands at more than 100 today5.
Here are some interesting facts:
•	 At present, the daily foreign exchange trading happens to be close to $6 trillion
which is close to a third of the U.S. GDP.
•	 Barely 1 percent of foreign exchange trading is actually related to merchandise trade.
The rest of it may be easily linked to the exotic financial innovations.
In recent years the financial markets have also opened up to remarkable strategies of gaming.
Increasingly, this has taken the form of casino-type gambling, the associated risks of which
will be examined in chapter 6.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

For now, let’s concentrate on the mechanics of the currency markets. What makes these
markets extra special is their round-the-clock fast and furious trading. This involves:
•	 Trading currencies for each other which means buying under-valued currencies
in the hope that they will appreciate and selling over-valued currencies for the
opposite reason
•	 Trading financial assets that have a currency convertibility feature; that is, these
assets may be converted into currency at a moment’s notice.
•	 Reserve assets are also an important component of the currency markets. These
include gold and special drawing rights of nations at the IMF. Reserve assets also
include foreign exchange assets which are a mix of currency, deposits and securities
and various other claims.
Here it is worthwhile to note that currency considerations involve much more than simply
exchange rates which are merely the prices of currency in terms of one another. Generally
speaking, when the price of the euro rises with respect to the U.S. dollar that means:
•	 The euro is getting stronger (appreciating) while the dollar is weaker (depreciating).
•	 Europeans will be able to buy more in global markets but sell less by way of exports
•	 A strong euro could easily fuel a Eurozone trade deficit
Since a strong currency enables a country to buy more imports while a cheap currency makes
one’s exports cheaper to international buyers, currency markets are intricately connected to
merchandise trading and could easily impact the global economy without much warning.
This is where reserve assets come in. These are mostly used to address trade imbalances
inasmuch as a trade deficit may be settled using reserve assets while a trade surplus may
be used to build reserves for future use. Naturally, gold fits in rather well as an attractive
means for settling a nation’s debt.
Although the American dollar is no longer backed by gold, the value of the dollar and the
price of gold are still indirectly related. This is because when trading nations lose faith in
the American dollar for whatever reason, they turn to gold as a backup. Thus when the
dollar weakens in value, gold typically rises in price.

Overall, currency reserves for countries serve pretty much the same role as credit cards or
cash on hand for individuals. Consequently, countries use currency reserves and gold to:
•	 settle trading imbalances
•	 protect themselves against market-related adversities for no one knows where and
how the next crisis will strike.
•	 use currency reserves to either strengthen or weaken a currency in global markets.
The reserves of foreign exchange and precious metals are typically controlled by a country’s
central bank which is in charge of addressing the international payment imbalances that
may arise from time to time.
There are of course other ways to address a persistent trade imbalance. The most attractive
one is by weakening one’s currency, thereby making the exports cheaper in global markets
and building a trade surplus.
Any country can accomplish this feat by buying some international reserve currency using
one’s own money. This creates an extra demand for the reserve currency while making one’s
own currency cheaper in global markets.

Just as weakening a currency can create a trade surplus, however, allowing trade deficits to
grow over time could also weaken a country’s currency. Furthermore, if a country depends
heavily on the import of essential resources such as oil, then domestic inflation becomes
very likely.
All things considered, currency manipulation is an easy way to build competitive advantage
in trade. China has lately gotten a bad rap for consistently keeping its currency weak so as
to keep its products cheap and attractive in global trade. That dubious distinction has lately
been extended to Denmark, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Switzerland and Taiwan6.
As may be expected, currency manipulation is frowned upon in global trading circles. This
is because:
•	 currency manipulation violates the established articles of agreement of the IMF.
•	 The WTO could advise the affected nations to impose tariffs on the imports from
the currency manipulators.
Understandably, with all the complexities associated with currency values, the sheer
anticipation of foreign exchange market interventions might lead countries to build up
reserves as a defensive measure. However, this in turn could drive trade and exchange into
unexpected directions, not to speak of distorting trade and capital flows, thereby feeding a
speculative frenzy all around.
Sadly, a simple currency manipulation cannot render a nation totally immune from global
economic crises. This has has been demonstrated by many nations caught in the global
economic slowdown of recent years.

2.8	 BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
Let’s now take up the important question of balance of payments (BOP) accounts which
means keeping track of the flow of merchandise trade and financial capital for a country.
The following are three essential components of BOP:
•	 Current account: keeps track of merchandise and services imports and exports
•	 Capital account: keeps track of the flow of financial capital in and out of a country
•	 Reserve position: keeps track of a country’s holding of foreign currency reserves
and other reserve assets

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

While a trade deficit has to be paid up sooner or later, a trade surplus could easily be
invested in foreign assets or else simply used to build up reserves. When the current account
produces a surplus, a country has the choice of either paying off its foreign debt or buying
up foreign assets including its international reserves.
Over the last three decades the long-term debt positions of many developing economies have
gone down. This reflects their improving trading positions. Most often, countries that are
doing well in global markets would also attract investor capital from overseas which would
strengthen their currencies and produce a surplus in the capital account.
Taking the current and capital account changes altogether, the reserve position may be fully
understood. There can either be an overall build-up of reserves on a net drain. This suggests
that the international reserve holdings of a country acts almost as a buffer or a safety valve.
Reserves function almost as a form of insurance against unforeseen contingencies, as we
saw in the previous section. However, any increase in the reserve holdings by an emerging
market economy may suggest that it has been getting increasingly cautious which may have
unintended consequences. This happens to be especially true in the current era of progressive
financial globalization.
However, so long as a nation is engaged in trade, balance of payments problems are
unavoidable. In the worst case, balance of payments difficulties could lead to economic crises.
For instance, a situation could arise where a country is unable to find sufficient financing
on affordable terms to meet its international payment obligations. This could easily trigger
a sense of panic among overseas lenders.
As it happens, in the face of growing uncertainty, foreign creditors may refuse to loan any
more money or even to restructure existing loans. To make matters worse, foreign investors
may even lose confidence in the country and pull their money out. This is often described
as a “capital flight” which means:
•	 A massive drain of financial capital as investors take out money from a country
in droves.
•	 A steady outflow of capital that can quickly deplete currency reserves.
•	 A steep currency depreciation that could lead to economic slowdown or collapse
Apart from disrupting many lives and livelihoods, the problem could easily spread to
neighboring countries thereby triggering a contagion.

This is where the IMF is at its operational best in devising:
•	 corrective policies to steer a country out of danger
•	 providing loans as necessary to give the ravaged nation some breathing room
•	 install much-needed reform to create conditions for strong and sustainable growth
and restore employment levels
However, before a member country gets a loan, the national authorities have to sit down
with the IMF and agree on a regimen of reform policies. This often means drastic moves
to balance the government’s budget which may translate into severe austerity measures.
Down the road there inevitably arises the question of whether the IMF will get repaid
after all its good deeds. That depends on how fast a country is able to resolve its balance
of payments problems and is back on its feet.
There is always a danger that a country may not be able to pay off its external debt real
fast without slipping into even more economic compression, the results of which could be
totally disastrous.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Structure of Globalization

2.9	 SOVEREIGN DEFAULTS
When foreign creditors demand immediate repayment of loans but a country’s banking
institutions have insufficient reserves and cannot be bolstered by the central bank then it
could easily lead to a sovereign default situation.
On occasion, an inability to pay back one’s creditors may be due to built-in weaknesses
in the domestic financial system itself. One could cite a whole range of related problems:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

unprofitable institutions supported over time by the state
large and persistent fiscal deficits
high levels of external or public debt
inappropriate pegging of exchange rates
sudden surge of inflation in essentials such as food and fuel
domestic unrest and civil strife
armed conflicts or outright war
natural disasters and calamities

Any combination of these problems could trigger serious trading imbalances and cause
foreign exchange reserves to be drained very fast.
In the past, a failure to repay foreign debts has often led to military invasions. Luckily these
days, a declaration of national insolvency rarely escalate into violent skirmishes. Instead
governments turn to:
•	 drafting agreements with creditors that typically involve restructuring the debt and
design repayment plans.
•	 designing agreements that could involve a paring down of the debt which often
comes at the expense of the creditors.
Since 2000 there have been several sovereign defaults in the world but Argentina stands
out, having faced two sizeable defaults in thirteen years (2001 and again in 2014). Back in
2001 a crazy scenario began to unfold that could be best put together as follows:
•	 the U.S. dollar began to get stronger
•	 Argentinian peso being pegged to the dollar began to get strong as well
•	 The strong peso led to falling commodity exports at a time when their prices were
already falling.
•	 Earlier Brazil had devalued its currency (called “real”)
•	 Foreign investment began to leave Argentina and fly into Brazil.

Since Argentina already was facing a growing fiscal deficit, the prospect of a capital drain
drove up domestic interest rates and began to squeeze out domestic private investment. This
led to companies being shut down, a soaring unemployment and a deep economic recession.
The tipping point for Argentina came when the IMF refused to lend it any more money.
Open declaration of bankruptcy was the only way out.
By far the biggest sovereign default in history took place in Greece in March 2012. The
situation was only slightly different from the Argentinian case. The symptoms were:
•	
•	
•	
•	

Large government deficits and debt build-up
widespread tax evasion in Greece
massive spending cuts and tax hikes on the heels of the default
growing incidence of street protests and riots

Luckily in the end, Greece seemed to be back on the path of recovery, thanks to a concerted
effort on the part of the IMF, the European Commission and the European Central Bank.
However, this meant painful austerity measures and a drastic restructuring of the country’s debt.
Unfortunately, tough austerity measures meant to help the countries back on their feet
invariably lead to higher unemployment, steep cuts in public services and benefits, not to
speak of a compromised reputation that would make it harder to borrow money in future.
As should be clear by now, trade flows, capital flows, currency values and domestic policies
are all interconnected thanks to what is popularly labeled as globalization. The slightest
disturbance on any of these fronts could easily send reverberations all over. This means that
all participants in global markets have to be extra-vigilant and careful with their domestic
plans so as not to rattle global investor expectations or the faith and confidence of their
trading partners.

2.10	 GROWTH PROSPECTS
Globalization continues to get top billing as the best solution for the world’s poverty.
According to most of its advocates, the greatest reductions in poverty in the last two decades
have occurred in countries that have gone the farthest to embrace openness and globalization.
As we have noted earlier, with more trade there is likely to be economic growth which in
turn is expected to lead to poverty reduction and general betterment.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Structure of Globalization

Perhaps the best illustration of this simple logic is the spread of modern medicine which is
a great byproduct of globalization. It has been a big factor in helping to:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

extend average life expectancy
reduce infant mortality
bring about higher standards of health and sanitation
install higher labor standards concerning work and wages
enhance public awareness about acceptable living conditions
bring uniformity in norms, standards, rules and practices within and across regions

It is therefore easy to see why economic isolation is unlikely to improve the lives and
livelihoods of a nation’s citizens. As a globally connected citizenry becomes more informed
about global trends and the advantages and living standards elsewhere; they then begin to
demand the same and this brings improvements all across the board.
In effect, free trade fosters the creation of a large and independently-minded middle class
that can also support an institutional framework for further growth and prosperity. The
idea is that human aspirations, once granted free expression, automatically create supporting
institutions which in turn create additional aspirations for a better life.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Structure of Globalization

Most prominently, norms and standards influence the quality of the products exchanged.
Given that trade brings in healthy competition, it helps to weed out products of inferior
quality as also to eliminate production methods that are hopelessly obsolete.
The ultimate goal is to build consumer confidence and there is nothing better than offering
better quality at affordable prices. Not surprisingly, by means of globalization, developing
countries gain access to the latest production technology which spares them from having
to go through the expensive and time-consuming process of developing all of it themselves.
For the emerging market economies of the world, globalization offers another distinct advantage
by way of opening fruitful channels for tapping into foreign capital for domestic investment
purposes, be it in infrastructure investments, such as port facilities, power generation, internal
transportation networks or new product lines and manufacturing facilities.
Consequently, opening up channels for foreign investment eases up the process of domestic
development and in turn facilitate the entry of multinational businesses. The multinational
corporations in turn tend to engage in massive capital ventures of their own which can give
an additional boost to the local plans for economic growth.

2.11	 FAIR TRADE
It is widely believed that by opening their markets to foreign producers, developing nations
can leapfrog onto the path of economic growth and prosperity. This saves the trouble of
having to develop the needed technology themselves from scratch for they can rely on a
cheap transfer of technology from the advanced economies.
This not only means a ready transmission of newer production techniques across national
borders but also growing opportunities for employee training and education that are expected
to enhance a developing nation’s stock of human capital.
As may be expected, technological change plays a very dominant role in globalization
compared to trade. However, this invariably introduces a skills bias in the economic growth
formula since technological progress makes ever-newer demands on worker skills. What is
likely to emerge at the end of the line is also a skills divide along with greater economic
inequality in the economy.
•	 Note: Skill-biased technological change means that there is a greater demand for
worker skills to support the use of the emergent technology.
•	 Note: Skills divide means the gap in income and prospects between workers who
are replaced by technology and the skilled worker those who work with technology.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Structure of Globalization

Even the most advanced nations of the world are not immune to an emerging skills divide in
the information age; the U.S. is a prime example as a widening wage gap and an increased
polarization of income have begun to define a new normal.
Not unexpectedly, globalization is being blamed these days for aggravating the gap between
the rich and the poor across nations. Critics contend that the marginalization of the poor is
revved up by global competition which usually brings about significant amounts of economic
disruption and displacement in the traditional sectors of labor-intensive or communitybased production.
To make matters worse, the advanced economies are not always helpful in forwarding the
cause of development. Despite substantial progress in the post-WWII era:
•	 Advanced economies continue to put up trade barriers against products (e.g. in
clothing, textiles and agricultural goods) that are all labor-intensive.
•	 Tariff barriers that exist between the developed and developing countries are much
higher than that barriers that exist among the developed countries themselves.
Note that these are precisely the types of barriers that destroy the comparative advantage of
the developing nations. Consequently, there are justifiable complaints from the developing
nations about trade fairness.
The WTO is expressly designed to address these concerns. Its main task is to bring unfair
trading practices to light which often means ruling against domestic regulations that impact
on trade. However, this does not mean that sovereign nations immediately have to comply.
Often enough, the advanced nations choose to ignore the WTO ruling altogether. For
instance, the EU has continued in its ban on imported beef treated with growth hormones
despite assurances from scientists that the treatment poses no hazard to public health.
In the event of a nation going against a WTO ruling, her trading partners can always
retaliate with trade restrictions of their own which do not help matters too much. Engaging
in a tit-for-tat game of trade barriers is ultimately a losing game for all parties concerned.
However, there are other ways to bring a recalcitrant trading partner back in line. Often
enough, the symbolic move of revoking the “most favored nation” status often bestowed
on nations can do the trick.

•	 Note: Most Favored Nation (MFN) status is when a country enjoys the benefit
of lowered tariffs and elimination of trade barriers with a select group of nations.
All members of the WTO fall into this category.
MFN is critically important for developing countries since by lowering the cost of their
exports they are given a competitive advantage. This can help with economic growth and
put them on a fast track to development.

2.12	 ECONOMIC FREEDOM
Those who see globalization as by far the best means for bringing about economic betterment
for vast swathes of humanity, the blessings of globalization are not too difficult to sum up:
•	 faster economic growth and improvements in per capita income
•	 fast reductions in poverty and improvement in living standards
•	 greater receptivity in the broader populace toward democracy

In addition, some even look to globalization as an effective way to:
•	 transfer wealth from producer-control to consumer-control
•	 promote justice, fairness and equity on a global scale
•	 create a virtuous circle of further gains in productivity and efficiency.
Consequently, globalization is often seen as the perfect means for fostering economic freedom
which is bound to translate into political freedom sooner or later. Thus the establishment of
free markets is widely seen as being conducive to democracy. After all, both market systems
and democracy are voting systems in their own way.
•	 Note: A market system operates under the rule of one dollar, one vote. A democracy
goes by the rule of one person, one vote. So both are in essence voting systems.
There is always hope that greater economic freedom will lead to greater political freedom
and improve peace and harmony all over the globe. However, this does not always hold
up in reality since there are many powerbrokers in the world who possess enough political
and economic clout to skew the rules of the market in their favor.
Recently, French economist Thomas Piketty became an overnight sensation by bringing to
light the problem of runaway inequality in income and wealth in the advanced nations of
the world. He puts forward the question of whether rising inequality might not over time
compromise the effective functioning of democracy, even in the developed economies of
the world7.
The tremendously powerful information technology of today has made it very hard to keep
facts and opinions from leaking out. Consider “cloud” computing for instance, which may
be imagined as a collection of huge storage spaces in the cyber universe commanded by
media giants who offer the storage service to their corporate clients for a price. This takes
globalization to a wholly different realm altogether.
Recently, there was a huge uproar about whether “cloud” computing could even be trusted to
keep private secrets since very personal pictures of celebrities kept leaking out. Alongside there
is the added concern about how social media has been made into an effective recruitment
tool for staging terror and mayhem across the world.

Understandably, this often drives some nations to desperation, as they block the internet
altogether but this may not be in the best interest of their citizenry. Nevertheless, it is hard
to deny that there is a more reasonable fear that amassing information without proper
direction could easily undermine established regimes and create instability. To be sure, an
informed citizenry may turn out to be just as unmanageable as an uninformed one and
there is no easy way to settle that debate.
Admittedly, information technologies are increasingly defining the forward march of
globalization. So long as it means creating a relatively open and safe forum for democratic
deliberations, it is a good thing. However, whether the ongoing global exchanges lead to
lasting peace around the world or a continuous stream of sporadic crises and conflict it
remains to be seen.

THEORIES
3.1	INTRODUCTION
There is no denying that globalization is an inherently multidisciplinary subject. It draws upon
the disciplines of international studies, international political economy and sociology to a
very large extent. This makes it quite difficult to fit it all into a single theoretical framework.
Where matters stand, it is just as easy to draw upon political science and international
affairs for understanding the phenomenon of globalization as it is to rely on anthropology,
history, cultural studies, sociology and geography to explain its various aspects.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Globalization: Relevant theories

Thus it would be simplistic to consider globalization as purely an economic phenomenon
when it comes to examining it in terms of origin, scope and implications. Nevertheless,
there appears to be general agreement among most experts that globalization is at heart a
long-term process that involves:
•	 economic expansion as represented by expanding markets in resources and finance
•	 economic integration of markets in both resources and finance across the globe
Within the discipline of economics, the subfield of international economics might be the
logical place to begin any exploration into globalization. But curiously enough, there is
rarely any mention of globalization in that field1. Perhaps this is because the idea does not
fit neatly into the conventional analytical framework of economic science.
As it is, the multidimensionality of globalization defies exhaustive theorizing. In addition,
it remains a formidable challenge to come to terms with two rival and very competing
questions that underlie the phenomenon:
•	 explaining globalization in and of itself as an economic process
•	 explaining larger economic or social phenomena using globalization as a theoretical
tool or instrument.
Since explaining globalization as a stand-alone entity is clearly different from using it as
a theoretical tool with which to explain broader economic and social phenomena, the
exploration itself raises deeper philosophical questions.
Be that as it may, if we choose to skirt around these esoteric questions, then the best way
to approach globalization might be to rely on theories that overlap both international
economics and international political economy. Even then we should try our best to avoid
the view that globalization does not involve much more than thinking about:
•	 resource flows across the globe
•	 international trade in terms of volume and pattern
•	 foreign exchange markets dealing with the value and flow of foreign exchange
However, given that our interest here is primarily in the economics of globalization, we
shall, in the interest of brevity, rely on:
•	 the economic theories that have a direct bearing on globalization
•	 the theories of international political economy that also have a lot to offer

Globalization: Relevant theories

In what follows, we shall first look at how the early sociological forays into emerging global
systems in the post-WWII years eventually broadened into wider explorations into the topic
of globalization.
Subsequently, we shall look at international economics and international political economy to
examine how the interrelationship between economics and politics has had a direct bearing
on the way we view globalization. This chapter concludes with a quick look at the radical
viewpoints that have begun to gather considerable momentum of late and the light they
throw on the inherent limitations of globalization economics.

3.2	 WORLD-SYSTEMS PARADIGM
From the 1970s on there has been a growing interest among researchers for studying the
new systems of production, consumption, finance and capitalization that were emerging all
over the world. The visibly multinational and transnational dimensions of the phenomenon
began to give rise to new economic, political and cultural realities, the impact of which
began to be hotly debated in scholarly circles.
Curiously enough, most globalization theories have developed against the backdrop of
growing criticism concerning
•	
•	
•	
•	

inequalities developing worldwide
newer modes of domination and exploitation promoted in the name of enterprise
marginalization and displacement of vast swathes of the global population
growing ecological fragility and risk of environmental disasters

To be sure, the ongoing debate concerning the merits of globalization is not likely to be
settled anytime soon. This is not least because the experts are still not clear about whether
globalization refers to
•	 a single process within a continuum of economic valuation
•	 a specific condition that may not be more than a passing phase.
Although there is no single answer to any of the questions above very few would disagree
that globalization is a hugely transformative process with its own distinctive momentum
that leaves markers that crisscross several disciplines with impunity.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Globalization: Relevant theories

By far the most famous harbinger of globalization theories is the world-systems paradigm
that was framed within a broader critique of capitalism as a global system. Wallerstein
(1998) was the originator of the world-systems perspective as he looked to the dynamics
of historical processes spanning five centuries.
What Wallerstein offered was a cohesive framework of macrosocial inquiry that was sharply
critical of the true import of globalization. The world-systems paradigm views the world to
be organized as a tiered hierarchy involving three key pieces:
•	 the core made up of the developed centers of economic power
•	 the periphery forcibly subjected to the core through colonialism and other not so
sinister means
•	 the semi-periphery comprised of states and regions in transit between the core
and the periphery, going in one direction or the other
While the core continues to maintain its economic power by means of trade advantages and
cultivated dependencies, the mobility between core and periphery could be quite heartening
in terms of long-term economic success. But it is not a dynamic that could be relied upon
as an automatic process nor to assure long-term health of a social order.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Globalization: Relevant theories

To date the world-systems camp has not been known to consider globalization as a fixed
concept nor does it subscribe wholeheartedly to a singular view of globalization. Not
surprisingly, as a theory of globalization the world-systems perspective comes up short; it
may be best described as an alternative take on the cherished idea of a global society popular
with free market fundamentalists.
Before we leave the topic however, it is worthy of note that the world-systems literature
promotes the view that the start of the new millennium symbolizes a great point of transition
which in another quarter century is likely to give rise to a global capitalist order the likes
of which has never been seen before.
This has led to the view that transnationalism might serve as a great alternative conceptual
framework in terms of which to understand the emerging global order. The result has been
a slew of descriptive studies of broader social processes triggered by globalization.
It is in this vein that the technologistic basis of globalization has been promoted which in and
of itself throws considerable light on a significant global process. The dynamics is explained
quite well through the concept of a “network society” as developed by Castells (1998).
The idea of the networked enterprise that reflects a network society, is the vanguard of an
emerging form of industrial organization that involves
•	 global financial markets that are the key to promoting market capitalization at
lightning speed
•	 ongoing revolutions in information technology that continue to collapse time and
space at an alarming rate
•	 a timeless and virtual approach to production and consumption that defies the
conventional bounds of cultures and institutions.
To be sure, what was enthusiastically billed early on as a globalized offering of an affluent
service economy worldwide did not pan out quite as expected. Over the past decade the early
optimism surrounding globalization appears to have dimmed quite a bit. Instead, what has
begun to take its place is a new realization about growing economic polarization between
the high-skilled professionals and low-skilled service jobs along with a growing concern
about the middle classes in affluent parts of the world being driven to near extinction.

3.3	 GLOBALIZATION ECONOMICS
These days even economists have begun to view globalization as a variegated process as
described by Rodrik (2011). He finds it to be a process that is both uneven and less
inclusive than popularly claimed. Undeniably, while market liberalism may still be viewed as
a dominant principle underlying globalization, there are several related economic processes
that do not always work in harmony.
In many ways, globalization is poised between two extremes:
•	 the idea of great convergence that claims that through globalization all nations
are bound to share prosperity over time
•	 the theory of great divergence according to which globalization makes nations
more polarized over time
Both of these views are dealt with at length in the annals of international political economy2.
According to the convergence thesis, there is a single global economy toward which all
market economies tend to drift over time.
The extensive literature in international political economy has a lot to say on the subject of
globalization as it is broadly seen as a phenomenon that has been reshaping the capitalist
world economy since the end of World War II.
As is to be expected, this is believed to have had far-reaching consequences regarding:
•	 Changing the nature and meaning of work. Most notably this has been seen in the
directional shift from manufacturing to service.
•	 Changing patterns of consumption around the globe, largely as consumers in the
global south emulate their counterparts in the global North
•	 Changing patterns in the organization and conduct of the social and cultural lives
of vast swathes of population around the globe
Given the range of competing perspectives on globalization it is no longer possible to view
it as a distinctive phase of capitalism nor necessarily one that is unique or novel.
The only things we may be sure of is that globalization appears to be synonymous with:
•	 the spread of capitalism as an economic system of allocation, production and
distribution
•	 an expanding economic system that functions best when contained within a broader
vision of democracy.

Accordingly, there cannot be any disagreement that the first decade of the 21st century
has seen the neoliberal vision of capitalism to emerge as the dominant economic system
around the globe. To recount its essential features, neoliberalism represents a doctrinaire
belief system that prefers:
•	 self-regulating markets for both resources and products
•	 the cultivation of democratic values through ever-widening markets
•	 improving the human condition through market efficiency and expanding markets
To the true believer in neoliberalism, what passes for globalization today is grounded in
the philosophical ideas that may be found in the writings of John Locke and Adam Smith.
•	 John Locke was a leading exponent of the central role of private property rights
in a market economy
•	 Adam Smith supported free markets as the best way to ensure enduring prosperity
and wealth creation.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Globalization: Relevant theories

Not unexpectedly, within the contentious field of economics, the practitioners are divided
into two distinct camps.
•	 An economic mainstream that considers globalization to be largely a positive
phenomenon (e.g. Bhagwati and Wolf )
•	 The critics of the mainstream who tend to adopt a reformist spirit (e.g. Krugman,
Stiglitz and Rodrik) and approach globalization as a mixed bag of both good and bad.
For a large number of prominent economists, including Joesph Stiglitz and Dani Rodrik,
the discipline of economics has not yet wholeheartedly engaged in studying globalization
as a distinctive field of study.
Nevertheless, it is hard to deny that there is a close relationship between free market liberalism
and globalization which became quite prominent in the 1990s. This was helped by several
epochal events that defined the onset of a new economy; these included:
•	 great advancement in computers, the internet and telecommunications
•	 large-scale integration of resource and commodity markets across the globe
•	 the end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union
While the information revolution brought in faster ways of communication, the fall of
state socialism also meant a breakdown in state control over production and distribution
mechanisms which had until then strapped the advanced capitalist economies of the world.
The freeing up vast swathes of the global population from the stifling weight of communism
also meant the opening up of largely unregulated markets all around the globe.
In many ways the tremendous potential for wealth creation unleashed as globalization went
into overdrive in the new century, the role of the state was sharply reduced, from economic
management to holding the line on taxes, regulation and inflation. This was meant to ensure
that markets could operate at maximum efficiency while individuals enjoyed abundant and
free choice.

3.4	 EARLY ENTHUSIASM
For Thomas Friedman, a noted America journalist, columnist and Pulitzer Prize winning
author, the latest round of globalization needed to be embraced without question as the
way of the future. Lexus and the Olive Tree, Friedman’s (2000) treatise on globalization
popularized wondrous accounts of globalization. The idea was to promote the phenomenon
as a progressive force that could not but work to promote the collective good.

Friedman famously credited globalization with several stupendous developments:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

compression of space and time
speeding up of communication
speedy movement of resources and capital
cognate developments in business practice (e.g. lean and flexible supply chains)
growth in networking to construct and maintain lifestyles

His enthusiastic account of the promise of globalization found distinct echoes in the world
of finance as expressed by Martin Wolf (2005). Drawing upon the classical insights of Smith
and Ricardo, Wolf engaged in a grand effort to combine them seamlessly to the free market
views of Hayek and came up with a resounding defense of globalization as a liberal market
phenomenon that deserved to be seen as:
•	 a positive influence in promoting economic health and prosperity
•	 a much needed boost to democracy and freedom the world over
These optimistic accounts dismissed most opposition to globalization to be thoroughly
unwarranted and at its basest, seriously misguided. Over the next decade however, that
unbounded optimism faded quite a bit since the neoliberal brand of globalization created
a lot of new challenges as we shall see later.

3.5	 THREE WAVES
Since the early 1980s when the globalization idea took off, economic theorizing on the
subject began to respond to its twists and turns with newer adaptations. Looking back,
the economic deliberations on the subject may be seen in terms of three noticeable waves:
•	 hyperglobalization thinking
•	 skepticism about globalization
•	 reformist thinking
As may be expected, for the true believers of free market liberalism, globalized markets are
the perfect expression of individual rational behavior and strategic agency. This reflected
in large measure a reaction to the stagflationary 1970s when the Keynesian ideas of statemanaged capitalism were famously discredited.

What followed was a push for a complete overhaul in economic thinking; this meant placing
economic reasoning upon largely neoliberal foundations. Accordingly, primacy was given to:
•	 individual rationality and strategic agency
•	 rational individual expectations and constant strategizing
•	 efficient markets and free market principles
In this revamped approach to globalization, individual rationality could be trusted to
provide all the necessary guidance to global market forces while also ensuring the stability
of the global economic order. In a way, global markets seemed to provide the perfect testing
ground for such an unadulterated doctrine based on free market principles. Unfortunately,
the results were not quite as perfect as was expected.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Globalization: Relevant theories

This led to a second wave of globalization theories offered by the skeptics who considered
globalization to be neither as a novel phenomenon nor truly global in scope3. They instead
pointed to the patterns of trade and exchange stretching across the nations of the globe
that are found wanting when it comes to the exaggerated claims of:
•	 all-inclusiveness in terms of shared prosperity
•	 equitable spread of economic benefits among all market participants
•	 balanced impact of real and money flows on development patterns and prospects
of nations
Evidently, there is a sharp distinction to be made between internationalization (e.g. global
expansion of markets) and globalization (e.g. fully integrated markets) and that question is
much more than merely a matter of semantics.
Prominent exponents of the second wave have since gone through great lengths to point
out how the globalization process is quite uneven. Often enough globalization does not
come across as being very balanced in its impact. This became particularly noticeable when
it comes to:
•	 the political fate of individual states
•	 the long-term economic health of nations
•	 the long-term prospect of national cultures
What followed were further expressions of skepticism concerning globalization and led to the
third wave of economic theorizing that took on a distinctively reformist flavor4. Generally
speaking, this camp is not opposed to:
•	 the ideas of market efficiency
•	 free market principles in achieving global market integration.
•	 finding market solutions to the stresses and strains of globalization
However, the idea that the problems of rising deficits of states, the challenges of uneven
development or even rising inequalities could all be relegated to the care of free markets does
not convince the reformist spirit. They are quick to point out that conventional prescriptions
pose a few dangers for the transitional economies.

In particular, the reformist group points out that a lot of transitional economies have
neither the capacity nor resources to withstand the oftentimes harsh recommendations of
the IMF and the World Bank which routinely call for balanced budgets, zero inflation and
deregulated financial markets5. For the well-heeled reformists, the following are the central
points of contention:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

the blanket removal of tariff barriers from agricultural trade
strict rules for debt restructuring or forgiveness
firm rules about state budgetary responsibility
upholding intellectual property rights in developing countries
unyielding carbon emission rules and trading rights
strict codes of corporate governance
firm global banking system rules

Inasmuch as conforming to the rule book means strict adherence to the rational vision of
the economic orthodoxy, it calls for an uncompromising adherence to market competition
as a blanket prescription for all economic contingencies. However, that position possesses
a few innate shortcomings all its own.
For instance, joining the global market place does not always mean that everyone ends up
playing by the same rules, despite the ongoing campaign of the WTO to create a level
playing field. Besides, when a nation’s development prospects depend on commodity and
natural resource exports then the odds may simply be too high to overcome.
Not surprisingly, for those who are not completely taken in by the specialized jargon of
mainline economic thinking, the idea of immutable economic laws does not hold much
meaning in the context of globalization nor is it valid to maintain that economic formulas
could somehow be executed with mathematical precision and scientific exactitude.
Nobel prize-winning economist, Joseph Stiglitz (2003), points out that:
•	 the neoliberal formula is simply too blunt an instrument to address the stresses
arising from globalization.
•	 different countries have different traditions, social institutions and different histories
so that a single spate of policy prescriptions may not suit everyone.

3.6	 INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS
Broadly speaking, globalization finds a natural home in international economics which
as a discipline is as much about trade as the study of money flows. Unfortunately, both
of these areas are riddled with the interplay of competing interests. As it happens, trade
and monetary issues cannot be neatly separated since they continue to feed off each other.
Consequently, the theoretical models on offer are often inadequate to address the challenges
posed by real world economic issues.
While international economics covers a whole host of subjects, from the costs and benefits of
trade, and balance of payments adjustments to exchange rate determination and international
capital markets, the key areas that directly relate to globalization are:
•	 international trade theory
•	 international factor movements
•	 international trade policy

Globalization: Relevant theories

3.6.1	 TRADE THEORY

In international trade theory, the contributions of David Ricardo, eminent economist of
the nineteenth century, have not lost much of their relevance. Ricardo offered the valuable
insight that trade occurs due to innate international differences in labor productivity. In
the last century this view has been extended to include:
•	 the varied endowments of natural resources and capital across nations
•	 the relative usage of various resources in the production of competing products
In the simplest Ricardian model, trade may be thought of as an indirect method of production.
A country’s production pattern is based on comparative rather than absolute advantage, that
is, the comparative efficiency in producing a good at home versus importing it from abroad.
Of course a primary issue here is the matter of comparative resource endowments. According
to the Hecksher-Ohlin trade theory, countries tend to
•	 export goods the production of which requires an intensive use of the factors that
are abundant.
•	 Import goods the production of which cannot be supported by the domestic factor
endowment
The important consideration here of course are the relative prices of the goods produced versus
those imported which is likely to have a very strong effect on the domestic income distribution.
This idea often elicits unqualified support from trade enthusiasts who consider trade to
be beneficial for a country’s economic health. Accordingly, trade is seen to be beneficial
even when:
•	 a country has lower productivity in all industries compared to its trading partners
•	 foreign industries enjoy low wages which helps them compete globally
•	 a country’s exports are more labor-intensive than its exports
The trouble with a blanket rationalization of trade is that we do not have exhaustive data on
productivity in all areas for all countries that are actively engaged in trade. Consequently, we
can never be absolutely sure whether trade leads to specialization and comparative advantage
or it is the other way around.

For instance, an absolute advantage in producing automobiles explains why Japan is a major
exporter of automobiles; in contrast, higher productivity in clothing does not prevent the
US from importing the same from newly industrializing countries like Mexico and China.
As it happens, Ricardo himself added a qualifier to the nifty concept of comparative
advantage6. He did not think that the idea fared well when financial capital itself has the
freedom to cross national borders, a caveat that the economic orthodoxy has continued to
ignore to this day.
More critically, discussions on the efficacy of trade have lately gone beyond the simplistic
terms of comparative advantage to include the patterns of international capital flows along
with the possibility of totally random factors influencing trade that defy economic logic.
As a result, international economics finds itself pulled across a myriad of competing topics:
•	
•	
•	
•	

the political economy of trade policy
policies of strategic trade
mechanics of exchange rate determination
macroeconomic policy coordination across nations.

All things considered, we can see that the specialized theories are no longer satisfactory
when it comes to dealing with the multidimensional phenomenon known as globalization.
3.6.2	 FACTOR FLOWS

According to conventional economic theory, free factor movements bring about factor price
equalization across countries but there are always mitigating factors. This is because real
wages and interest rates do not always equalize across national borders even in the presence
of free trade.
Consider for instance the fate of labor. Trade has long been believed to produce winners as
well as losers, especially when it comes to income distribution. Although we may assume
that winners can in principle compensate the losers, as is the case with neoliberals, but in
practice it may not be so easy to find a satisfactory resolution.
To complicate matters even further, the overarching question of income distribution that
arises from trade cannot be easily tamed through conventional cost-benefit analysis nor is it
tractable using the rigorous analytical frameworks favored by most economists. Furthermore,
most economists do not even consider the issue of income distribution to be so very special
as to warrant limiting trade7.

These days, the most important features of factor movements most certainly are:
•	 labor migration across national borders
•	 financial capital transfers through international borrowing and lending.
Although both of these movements may be thought of as analogous to the trade in goods
and services, there are clearly a few additional wrinkles to be ironed out.
While between the late nineteenth century and early twentieth, real wages were indeed on
a convergent path between destination and origin countries in the western world, the same
pattern does not seem to hold in the latest phase of globalization. Thanks to advanced
technology, it is jobs and not labor that have had an easier time moving across national
borders these days which means that the cherished idea of convergence may prove to be
elusive in the long run.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Globalization: Relevant theories

As may be expected, there are clearly political considerations associated with factor
movements that complicate matters quite a bit. Immigration is a hot-button issue in the
developed nations of the world today and this mostly concerns whether a free inflow of
foreign nationals is likely to be:
•	 a drain on the public purse due to an increased demand on public services (e.g.
education, healthcare, highways and domestic security)
•	 increase in tax revenues for the government due to additions to the labor force
and added productivity
For the most part, the effect of immigration on a government’s budget remains an ambiguous
issue8. This is not least because the skills sets that are brought into a country have a lot to
do with the results.
It is said that the 2015 surge of displaced Syrians is most likely to help improve the
economic picture of Germany by reversing the falling population growth rates and adding
productive power. However, the anticipated strain of social welfare programs on the public
purse continues to be viewed with alarm.
The question of benefits from trade becomes even more complex when we consider the
international movements of capital. This is in no way similar to the movement of labor since
the capital that moves is mostly in the form of financial asset transactions. This happens as:
•	 national banks make loans to other countries
•	 citizens buy stocks in foreign firms or invest through subsidiaries of foreign firms
What makes financial trade especially challenging is the fact that it invariably involves time
inasmuch as the purchasing power that is lent today in the form of loans is in exchange
for a promise of greater purchasing power in the future.
The type of exchange that occurs over a time period is called intertemporal trade in
economic jargon; this is generally explained in terms of how:
•	 some countries favor enlarged future consumption which generates loanable funds
for investment purposes
•	 some countries favor present consumption over future which calls for a demand
for loans
The tradeoff between present and future consumption is known as the real interest rate
and a differential in the real interest rate across nations tends to determine the direction
of capital flows.

If we look at the international capital flow patterns in the 1970s
•	 oil exporters like Saudi Arabia generated expendable capital to invest overseas
•	 Saudi funds were in turn channeled to fast developing countries such as Brazil and
South Korea that generated highly productive investment opportunities.
As we shall see in chapter six, direct foreign investment is an important part of international
capital movements and the most visible expression of it is through multinational corporations
(MNC). This involves not only a transfer of resources but also direct acquisition and control,
features that are not typical of international lending and borrowing.
Additional complications arise when we bring in exchange rate considerations. Whenever one
nation’s currency plunges compared to another, the former enjoys a clear trading advantage.
Thus a weakened currency in global exchange means:
•	 Cheaper export goods giving a nation a trade advantage
•	 Higher prices for imports and a risk of inflation
Often enough, drastic currency devaluations (as in the case of China in August 2015) produce
such advantages but much to the consternation of one’s trading partners. While exchange
rate determination has only recently become an important consideration in international
trade (ever since the U.S. abandoned the gold standard in the early 1970s), it is now a
central question in international economics.
There are two critical issues here that are important to note. Both continue to be hotly
debated:
•	 The merits of floating versus fixed exchange rates
•	 The national currencies to be counted as reserve currencies
Understandably, the earlier trade theories need to be thoroughly overhauled to address
the modern economic arrangements. In addition, the structural changes in participating
economies that have been necessary to create integrated markets for financial capital need
to be reviewed with some urgency.
As may be expected, the global capitalist dynamic is driven in large part by financial capital
that flows around the world in the form of credit, loans and grants. There are great risks
associated with the global flow of capital, a matter that we take up in chapter seven.

Suffice it to say here that the way credit is doled out cannot be treated separately from the
way periodic financial crises have rattled the global markets over the last three decades. A
lot of it has to do with the nature of the capital markets themselves; as money is loaned
out against promises to pay in the future, it presents a delicate balance that could easily be
unsettled by unexpected changes in:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

the exchange rate between national currencies
the comparative interest rates across nations
the trading relations between nations
national policy direction and political sentiments
regulatory environment across nations

As we can see there are many unknowns to deal with when it comes to international capital
flows. The slightest sign of turbulence in some remote corner of the globe could easily turn
out to be a tsunami that threatens to unsettle economies and unseat entire governments. That
in totality hints at the enormous powers of globalization as a formidable economic force.

3.6.3	 TRADE POLICY

For the most part the policies that governments adopt toward international trade involve
•	 taxes or tariffs
•	 subsidies on certain transactions
•	 legal limits on the value or volume of trade
Tariffs generally mean a tax levied on an imported good. It may take the form of a fixed
amount charged for each unit of a product imported. Alternatively, ad valorem tariffs are taxes
levied as a fraction of the value of an imported good. Either approach succeeds in raising
the price of the product in question, thereby limiting its attractiveness in the export market.
Tariffs are the oldest form of trade policy and until the introduction of the income tax,
most governments relied on tariffs to raise revenues. Generally speaking, tariffs tend to:
•	 raise revenues for the government
•	 protect domestic markets of select goods from cheaper foreign imports.
In the early nineteenth century the UK used tariffs to protect its agriculture from import
competition. The same tact was used by the US later on to protect its manufacturing goods
sector from being taken over by imports.
Subsidies are the exact opposite of taxes in the sense that they are designed to encourage
the production of a particular good or service. These days farm subsidies continue to be a
sensitive topic of contention in the global trading arena. Developing countries accuse the
developed nations of granting farm subsidies which they think give an unfair advantage to
the multinational agribusinesses at the expense of the more traditional farming interests in
the rest of the world.
However, tariffs are not the only form of trade restriction. Countries could use nontariff
barriers such as
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

import quotas
export-credit subsidies to the buyer of a product
national procurement: directing domestic firms to buy local
informal barriers through negative advertising of imports
export restraints (imposed by the exporting country at the insistence of the importing
country; e.g. U.S. asking Japan to limit its exports of cars to the American market
in 1981)

Most of these restrictions are designed to achieve the same goals. Although any kind of
trade restriction must have costs and benefits. While domestic industries could be protected
through tariffs it would also introduce:
•	 price gains that favor producers at the expense of consumers
•	 deterioration in the terms of trade over the long term
Then there are broader issues such as the impact of imports on domestic jobs and income
distribution. These are both sensitive issues that defy easy resolution.

3.7	 POLICY COORDINATION
To be sure, there has been a long-running debate in international economics about free
trade versus protectionism which is not likely to be resolved any time soon. It has been a
matter of key concern for economists since the sixteenth century when nation-states first
made their appearance.
The two popular arguments in favor of free trade are that:
•	 the efficiency gains from free trade are significant
•	 there are significant welfare gains from free trade
The pressing issue has always been whether to protect domestic industries from foreign
onslaught through the use of taxes, subsidies and quotas. Much of this is still central to
our discussions of globalization, as we see later in our discussion of the WTO. While the
champions of globalization may look at free trade as a worthy cause, it is clearly plagued
by opposing forces:
•	 growing national prosperity through free trade
•	 declining domestic wages and disappearing jobs through foreign competition
While the convergence of global wages remains almost an article of faith with proponents
of globalization, therefore, critics argue that this could easily amount to a “race to the
bottom” (Korten 2015).

Evidently, the impact of international trade on a nation’s income distribution is too significant
a matter to ignore. Clearly the answer depends on whether the factor of production serves
a general-purpose or is sector-specific:
•	 general-purpose factors can move across sectors with relative ease
•	 sector-specific factors only benefit or lose depending on how a particular sector
fares in the face of trade
To add to the complications, national governments cannot always be relied upon to follow
the recommendations of economists since there are always competing groups of vested
interests within countries in addition to diverse considerations involving history, culture,
tradition and social institutions.
The question of distribution aside, there is the pressing question of trade surplus and deficit
which comes under the heading of balance of payments.
•	 Note: Balance of Payments refers to the record of a nation’s transactions with the
rest of the world; it involves not only the international movements of goods and
services but of financial capital and foreign exchange

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Globalization: Relevant theories

While it is one thing to advocate free trade, when the terms of trade turns against a nation
and that also for an extended period of time, then there arises a lot of objections from all
quarters. The trouble is that not every nation can enjoy a hefty trade surplus year in and
year out without one or more of its trading partners complaining down the road. This is
just as true of the powerful United States as it is for Brazil, an emerging nation by global
economic standards.
This brings us to the matter of international policy coordination which undoubtedly is a
very tricky area of international economics. The biggest challenge on the global front is
how to coordinate
•	 international trade agreements so as to create a level playing field
•	 international monetary environments so as to minimize price uncertainty
One of the main purposes of policy coordination is to ensure that commodity and capital
flows are not interrupted very severely at any time. This is where the World Bank, the
IMF and the WTO assume a very critical role. These institutions are meant to oversee and
harmonize competing global interests while maintaining a sense of balance.
As we can well imagine, there are broader ramifications of economic policies that may not
be easily accounted for by narrowing the scope of analysis to the matters of quantitative
mechanics and accountability, questions with which economists are largely preoccupied.

3.8	 RADICAL PERSPECTIVE
At the far end of the ideological spectrum there are the Marxist critics who view globalization
as no more than an extension of the exploitation formula that underlies the logic of capitalism.
They contend that globalization is part of a production scheme that is programmed to
exclude a sense of reasonable balance and equity.
Radicals find it rather exceptionable that the advocates of globalization should continue to
•	 emphasize the role of individual rationality
•	 focus on representative agents engaged in constant strategizing
•	 reduce the human condition to market prices and contingent valuation
On the whole the radical theorists find capitalist enterprise to be all too forcefully directed
toward the cultivation of personal advantage but at great social cost9.

The radical movement has lately been energized by:
•	 the emergence of new market-driven economies that do not subscribe completely
to the neoliberal ideology (e.g. India, Brazil).
•	 the visible unevenness of the impact of unfettered markets around the globe (e.g.
rising inequality in income and wealth distribution)
•	 the social and economic wreckage left by the 2008 banking crisis
•	 the distorting effect of sovereign wealth funds on international investment patterns
In particular, we can take note of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and
South Africa) none of which subscribe to the stringencies of the neoliberal ideology that
remains popular in the Anglo-Saxon world. Not surprisingly, there are very cogent and
empirically grounded arguments forwarded to express considerable skepticism about freerange globalization10.
They argue against the perceived inevitability of globalization as promoted by its advocates
by pointing out that:
•	 globalization does not invariably create transnational corporations that may be
trusted to spread jobs and prosperity all around
•	 capital mobility is not truly global since it is mostly confined among the developed
nations of the world;
•	 there are no significant shifts in investment and employment from the developed
world to the developing nations
As it happens, most trade, investment and financial capital flows happen to be confined to
North America, Europe and Japan. It is true that China and India have lately become key
players on the global circuit but even then the true extent of globalization is not as large
as its promoters want us to believe.
Given that the predominant economic flows in our world are largely confined to three
privileged regions suggests that these areas have considerable power and influence over these
currents and likely to play them for their own advantage.
From the radical perspective, globalization is not only an implicit trait of capitalism but it is:
•	 an inherently unstable phenomenon
•	 operational only through continuous crises

Most radicals find indubitable proof of these undesirable traits in the sophisticated financial
innovations that are believed to have paved the road to the global financial crisis in 2008.
In particular these involved:
•	 the securitization of debt through collateralized debt obligations
•	 credit default swaps that offered insurance against risky financial products
Not surprisingly, these and other visible strains of unevenness continue to fuel virulent forms
of activism against the entire globalization campaign. The activists never fail to stress that
•	 the globalist ideology is inherently regressive in nature
•	 what passes for global enterprise is innately exploitative
Sadly, the version of globalization generally promoted in the popular presses tends to conceal
most of these questionable traits under the guise of free enterprise.

3.9	 ON BALANCE
The health of a market system depends on healthy competition and a steady expansion of
markets, both of which are conducive to promoting specialization and the cultivation of
intricate divisions of labor. These in combination with economies of scale and scope continue
to drive down the cost of production while making products and services more affordable.
For its advocates, globalization must be credited for bringing about:
•	 a clear rationalization of global production as advancing technology crosses national
boundaries
•	 competitive pressures for continual innovation and improvement
•	 vast improvements in the economic position of the global citizenry by way of higher
real wages and living standards.
No doubt these benefits need to be balanced against the costs associated with globalization.
One of the clear costs concerns the matter of income and wealth distribution. In other
words, we need to question if the benefits of globalization are in fact being evenly distributed
among all layers of the citizenry of a participating nation.
These days the questions of fairness and equity are at the forefront of public concerns as it
becomes clearer that the benefits of globalization are not shared equitably among individuals,
organizations, nations and regions. Indeed there is a growing perception that the benefits
of globalization tend to settle disproportionately on those who are already well off11.
While optimists tend to maintain that globalization should be trusted to bring about a
convergence of incomes across the globe the supportive evidence is weak at best. Even
after the recent push to put globalization into over-drive it seems that broad swathes of
developing nations in Africa, Asia and Central America are yet to benefit from its bounty.
Evidently, a critical problem with globalization is that
•	 the cultivated interdependence between nations tends to aggravate potential instabilities
•	 minor economic fluctuations in one part of the globe could easily cascade into a
major crisis engulfing a whole host of nations.
Such was the 1998 foreign exchange crisis that started in Thailand and quickly spread across
Southeast Asian economies. The drama was repeated ten years later with a global financial
crisis that pushed the advanced economies of the world toward complete collapse. It may
just be that the worldwide recessions or depressions that were endemic in the 1930s are
not such a remote possibility in the present day.

Very few are likely to doubt that globalization carries a clear potential for increasing economic
volatility across the world. Often enough, economic conflict could easily fuel military
conflict, inviting thereby a replay of the interwar period of skirmishes that eventually led
to an all-out World War.
Perhaps the most serious problem with globalization is a shift in the locus of control of
national economies from sovereign governments to:
•	 regional or global powers
•	 multinational or transnational corporations
•	 international organizations.
In other words, it is quite possible that globalization can undermine national sovereignty
with impunity.
As readily as these sentiments can provide a linefeed into extreme patriotism, nationalism
and xenophobia, all of these strains are becoming readily visible across the globe. We may
very well be heading toward the forging of a new world order without knowing what form
it is likely to take. Meanwhile there is ample evidence of dissonance and polarized views
among broad sections of the global citizenry who are susceptible to extreme ideologies and
explosive outcomes.
It is time we questioned the extent to which we are still able to
•	 capitalize on the positive potential of globalization through cooperation between
nations
•	 minimize the negative effects of globalization by building supranational institutions
of the order of the World Bank, the IMF, WTO and the OECD.
These days of high speed economic activity, the supranational institutions have to be far
more vigilant than in the past, bringing about sanctions and serving as effective arbiters
in global disputes. They need to monitor and oversee the dynamics of global phenomenon
very closely.
In this venture economics cannot be the only factor of interest since there are equally
important noneconomic factors that can easily derail the best laid plans of economic success.
The most pressing matters for us remain:
•	 the question of global security
•	 the growing concern about geopolitical uncertainty
•	 the overarching question of environmental health.

So long as the globalization agenda remains committed to the neoliberal mindset we will
continue to see uneven economic developments around the globe that strain national and
international relations. A quite telling example of growing signs of discord is the recent
Brexit move. The fateful decision of the citizens of United Kingdom to break away from
the European Union was made on June 23, 2016 through a popular referendum.
All those who voted to remain feared the worst. They were afraid that global companies and
the headquarters of global financial institutions might decide to desert Britain en masse.
The fear is all too palpable that a massive capital outflow might jeopardize the economic
health of the United Kingdom.
Through it all, it was hard not to see Brexit as a clear vote against globalization though not
so completely against the idea of integrated markets. There can be no doubt that Britain still
wishes to remain within the European common market but would not like to be bound by
all the rules on the ground concerning economic policy coordination. Thus Brexit appears
to have been a vote more against the seemingly excessive regulations of the Eurozone than
against the spirit of free trade and open markets.

Globalization: Relevant theories

In any event, the aftermath of the referendum occasioned several cautionary steps were
taken to neutralize the shock of Brexit.
•	 the Bank of England loosened up monetary policy quite significantly
•	 the new government under the stewardship of Theresa May moved fast to tone
down the talk of fiscal austerity favored by the previous administration.
In the financial markets there appears to be great concern about the value of the sterling
pound and the problem it is likely to have once Brexit begins to bite starting in 2017. For
a net importing country such as Britain, a strong currency is much needed as is the access
to open markets around the world. Without it there is always a risk of inflation combined
with an economic slowdown. Inasmuch as Brexit appears to have jeopardized both the value
of the currency and easy access to export markets, the long-term health of the economy is
put under great pressure.
The post-Brexit challenges facing the United Kingdom concern all of the following:
•	 the trade advantages reaped by lower tariffs that will follow the departure from EU
may prove to be elusive
•	 the loss of free access to the European markets
•	 the likely limitations to accessing global credit for investment purposes.
It is difficult to see how these competing forces that continue to tug at the future economic
prospects of a newly liberated Britain can be addressed sensibly. The two most important
questions that remain to be answered are jobs and investment both of which happen to be
in uncertain territory at the moment.
In sum, post-Brexit economic success depends on the extent to which Britain will have:
•	 continued access to the European markets
•	 continued access to global credit markets
•	 export advantage due to a cheaper sterling pound

3.11	 GLOBALIZATION’S FUTURE
There is no doubt that the shape of the world economy in the 21st century could not have
been anticipated even half a century ago. Today’s world is well into the maturation phase
of a process that was unleashed at the conclusion of World War II. The latest surge since
the end of the Cold War has been facilitated by
•	 great strides in information technology
•	 continued commitment of most industrialized nations to a free movement of capital
and free trade
Undoubtedly, the United States has been a dominant force in shaping the latest round of
globalization. This has been accomplished largely by:
•	 establishing multilateral institutions to facilitate trade
•	 sponsored trade rounds that continue to bring most participating nations to the table
•	 opening up markets in the developed world and promoting commercial liberalism
However, eminent scholars of international relations see visible signs of strain amid the great
explosion of trade and investment around the globe12. The most notable among these are:
•	
•	
•	
•	

the steady erosion of the Bretton Woods rulebook established in 1944
growing reluctance of the US to provide strong political leadership
growing risk of financial upheavals that can threaten the global markets
gathering currents of economic nationalism across the developed world

Clearly, the departure from a gold-backed US dollar in the 1970s (Bretton Woods) eroded a
big chunk of the economic guarantees behind globalization. While it may be easy to argue
that this signature move facilitated free movement of financial capital around the globe, it
also meant enhancing the volatility of international finance, a questionable prospect that
most advocates of globalization choose to forget.
Instead of forging larger global alliances, the receding of the shadow of the Cold War, has
witnessed the emergence of several regional economic blocs:
•	 The European Union
•	 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
•	 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)

Given that the Chinese yuan has recently joined the US dollar, the UK pound, the euro
and the Japanese yen as an international reserve currency only reinforces the idea that the
promise of global integration is fast being replaced by a global economy pulled between
competing regional blocs that are in turn dominated by fewer powerful economic players.
As it happens, more and more of the trade deals, tax arrangements and investment activity
are taking place outside of the rule-based regimes of the postwar period. The economic
globalization that we witness today appears to be in dire need of new rules and institutions
but how quickly these are likely to be established is impossible to predict. The prospect of
globalization looks uncertain at best.

4	 NATURE AND ENVIRONMENT
4.1	INTRODUCTION
The environment is an inherently global construct. This should be evident from the many
life-sustaining ecosystems and watersheds without which our lives would have been impossible.
Consider for instance the atmosphere; it protects our climate while shielding us from very
harmful UV rays.
We have little choice but to view the environment as a common heritage of humankind
that cannot possibly be cordoned off for private use. Furthermore, given that environmental
pollution does not respect national boundaries nor any imaginary lines that we may believe
to divide continents or oceans, the environment needs to be responsibly managed in the
collective interest.
However, the task is quite difficult with globalization pushing for ever-higher standards of
living all the time. It cultivates an appetite for all kinds of products and services which in
turn fuels an ever-enlarging scale of consumption, production and unavoidable waste. A
few side-effects are:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

greater waves of urbanization
large-scale expansions in infrastructure and superstructure
an expanding scale of landscape intrusion
destruction of natural surroundings
interruption of the natural processes of drainage and filtration
interruption of the processes of natural rejuvenation

The tremendous surge in globalization and industrialization in the last couple of decades
has increased the overall scale of exploitation and transportation of raw materials, fuels and
goods to heretofore unimaginable levels.
The trouble is that not all the associated costs are faced by the present generation but passed
onto the future. Consequently, the undesirable effects may be felt over many generations
to come. What makes matters worse is when the impact is irreversible.
Take plastics for instance; it is one of the most toxic pollutants and it is a non-biodegradable
product. It has the potential to influence the environment long after the immediate
consumptions needs have been satisfied.

In this section we shall first familiarize ourselves with environmental basics before looking
at how globalization interacts with the environment. We shall examine the endowment of
natural resources, the environmental stresses and scarcities that accompany globalization
and the economic questions that arise therefrom. The chapter concludes with a look at the
promise of renewable resources and the pressing matter of sustainable development.

4.2	 NATURAL RESOURCES
We have already noted that globalization is all about expanding markets. As may be expected,
opening up new markets very often means finding new reserves of natural resources as well.
This often means laying claims on:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

virgin forests (e.g. rainforests in Latin America and Southeast Asia)
untapped mineral reserves (e.g. bauxite, tungsten, cobalt)
fossil fuels (e.g. coal, natural gas, oil)
fish and wildlife
fresh water sources (e.g. the Great Lakes in North America)

In the past four years we have drilled

89,000 km
That’s more than twice around the world.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Nature and environment

Unfortunately, none of these resources are as abundant as we would like to imagine. A
growing scarcity of valuable resources is therefore inevitable as populations continue to grow
along with greater demands for a better standard of living.
The problem of scarcity extends from oil, timber and metal all the way to energy, water,
ecosystems, biodiversity and the atmosphere. While the world’s natural resources are too
numerous to count, we shall look at three broad groupings:
•	 minerals (e.g. iron, copper)
•	 fossil fuels (e.g. coal, oil)
•	 ecosystems (e.g. water, rainforest)
4.2.1	MINERALS

There is already a growing perception that the global economy is slowly drifting toward
acute shortages in the supplies of non-renewables.
A 2012 BBC report on the remaining stock of global resources noted that some essential
minerals are likely to run out within the next twenty years. Following the time line of
resource exhaustion, we might sample a critical list:
•	 Antimony used for drugs and batteries (supply to run out within the next decade)
•	 Indium used for touchscreens and solar panels (expected to run out in twelve years)
•	 Silver for awards medals and jewelry (expected to run out within the next two decades)
If the horizon of resource exhaustion is extended to about fifty years then three more metals
could be added to the list; they are:
•	 Copper, needed for brass, wires and piping
•	 Titanium, needed for aircraft and armor
•	 Tantalum, needed for mobile phones
4.2.2	 FOSSIL FUELS

Within the next decade the fossil fuels that are in serious danger of being depleted are: oil,
natural gas and coal. Currently these three provide close to 90% of the energy needs of
the world. By the end of the 21st century nearly all of the fossil fuels that are economically
recoverable (i.e. profitably extractable) are likely to be gone.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Nature and environment

Since around 80% of the global international trade in goods relies on ocean shipping, it
means a significant consumption of fossil fuels. Consequently, any depletion in fossil fuels
must have a sizeable impact on maritime transport.
The same may be said of air transport as well since each ton of freight moved by plane
uses about fifty times as much energy per kilometer compared to moving the goods by
ship. Add to that the rising costs of ground transport and the picture is not too appealing.
As yet we do not have cheaper or better substitutes for oil. Admittedly, there are unconventional
hydrocarbons that are gradually becoming more available. These include:
•	
•	
•	
•	

liquefied natural gas
heavy oil (used for marine diesel engines)
synthetic oil made from chemical compounds artificially made
biofuels (e.g. ethanol, biodiesel and biogas)

These alternative sources of energy have undoubtedly added to the existing oil supplies but
this cannot detract from the fact that the largest and most productive oil fields are fast
becoming depleted while new discoveries have been very slow to come on line in the sense
of being commercially viable.
The recent tapping into proven reserves of shale gas, most notably in the U.S. and Canada,
may have postponed the day of reckoning by a decade or two. But according to the Parisbased International Energy Agency, by 2030 the rate of decline in fossil fuels is likely to
fast accelerate1.
Notwithstanding our boundless optimism regarding the technological possibilities of the
future, once the reserves of fossil fuel go into serious decline, no technology may come up
with suitable substitutes to pick up the slack.
4.2.3	ECOSYSTEMS

The last on the resource list marked for rapid depletion are our ecosystems. An ecosystem
refers to an environment made up of living species and non-living elements. The essential
components of most ecosystems are: water, air, sunlight, soil, plants, microorganisms, insects
and animals.

Ecosystems fall into three major classes:
•	 terrestrial ecosystems (e.g. tundra, deciduous forest, tropical rain forest)
•	 fresh water ecosystems (e.g. streams, rivers and lakes)
•	 marine ecosystems (e.g. coral reef, estuaries)
In our growing world there is a greater need for the production of crops and biofuels;
this is already causing tropical forests to be cleared continually. Not surprisingly, this also
hastens the extinction of animal species while bringing about a degradation of biodiversity.
The result is a loss of vital ecosystem services such as:
•	
•	
•	
•	

nutrient retention in the soil
supply of clean water
availability of top soil
carbon storage capacity

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Nature and environment

Moving onto water ecosystems that are equally vital to our lives and livelihoods, we find
that they are hugely instrumental in:
•	 replenishing water resources
•	 purifying water resources
Consequently, a blanket elimination of marshes and wetlands in favor of economic development
is rather shortsighted. Given that wetlands and marshes are a natural sponge for runoffs,
their elimination means:
•	 A diversion or alteration of the flow of surface water
•	 increased exploitation of underground aquifers
•	 contamination of groundwater by waste and discharges from industry and transport,
household and human waste.
Tragically, marine ecosystems are not beyond the pale of a changing environmental reality
either. Some of the best examples of a recent decline in marine habitats are:
•	 mangrove forests in intertidal zones (i.e. an area of the shore that is between the
low and high points of the tide)
•	 seagrass beds that fringe coastlines
•	 salt marshes that are important as natural storm barriers
•	 shellfish reefs that filter seawater
Modelling studies by American scientists a few years ago estimated that the northern polar
waters could become completely ice-free within a few years2. This is part of the global
warming phenomenon that is much talked about. It is expected to contribute to a sea level
rise thereby inundating coastal habitats.
The growing concerns about coastal ecosystems have to do with the:
•	
•	
•	
•	

wetlands that act as natural filtration systems for freshwater
estuaries that provide choice habitat for fish and other foods sources
irreplaceable mangroves that are home to crabs, shrimp, oysters and mussels
coral reefs that are essential spawning, breeding and feeding grounds of numerous
organisms

All of these key pieces of the coastal ecosystem act not only as indispensable barriers against
sea level fluctuation but valuable storehouses of biodiversity.

4.3	 ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSES
The most visible impact of the complex interaction between globalization and industrialization
falls on the ecological cycle as pollution levels begin to rise at all levels. The outcome is an
all-around reaction chain that involves:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

an overall increase in the greenhouse effect.
depletion of ozone layers
straining of nonrenewable sources of energy
release of various undesirable chemicals into the soil
the growth of many noxious weeds and plants

The rest of this section looks at the environmental stresses produced by the greenhouse
effect, the process of deforestation and the overexploitation of oceans and ecosystems.
4.3.1	 GREENHOUSE EFFECT

Admittedly, the needs of development cannot be ignored but one of the fastest growing
problems in our world today is carbon dioxide emission. These emissions are due to:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

burning coal, natural gas and oil for electricity and heat
industrial emissions from chemical, metallurgical and mineral transformation processes
deforestation and clearing land for agriculture
management of agricultural soils, livestock, rice production and biomass burning
fossil fuels (petroleum-based fuels: gasoline, diesel) burned for transportation (road,
rail, air and marine)
•	 commercial and residential buildings: on-site energy generation and burning fuels
for home-heating or cooking
Nitrogen and other gases are also released into the atmosphere from biodegradable waste
and wastewater that release methane and other gases. The increased emission of greenhouse
gases succeed in trapping the rays of the sun in the earth’s atmosphere. Scientists find the
resulting greenhouse effect to be largely responsible for global warming and climate change3.
Increasingly it appears that the surface temperature of the earth is rising which in turn
is causing polar ice sheets and ice caps to melt. Scientists trace the rise of the earth’s
temperature to:
•	 a phenomenal growth of industrialization in the developing world
•	 a massive increase in the level of transportation crisscrossing the globe
•	 a growing reliance of humans on fossil fuels

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Nature and environment

Transportation alone has increased manifolds within a relatively short period of time, causing
the emission of greenhouse gases to rise spectacularly.
4.3.2	DEFORESTATION

Another factor that aggravates the problem of carbon emissions is deforestation. About half
of the forests that once covered the earth are already gone. But deforestation is still advancing
at an alarming rate and penetrating into the remaining areas of undisturbed forest due to:
•	 Timber concessions that lead to cutting down age-old trees
•	 Rapid logging using modern technology and equipment
•	 Expanding global timber market due to changing fashions (e.g. hardwood flooring
in modern homes)
It may be said that most of the native forest wood currently exported from Australia
amounts to destroying a great natural heritage. However, what makes the preservation of
any natural heritage so difficult is that in the wake of globalization, goods and people are
constantly on the move.

Nature and environment

This means a constant demand for building infrastructure and superstructure ranging from
new seaports and airports to high speed railways. This often means zipping open densely
forested areas to create roadways using no more than a bulldozer.
4.3.3	OVERFISHING

Today even the world’s oceans are not safe from the grasping reaches of globalization. The
most significant problem facing our oceans are:
•	 big fishing trawlers that continue to vacuum up fish from the ocean
•	 overfishing that pushes fish stocks down below acceptable levels.
This is reminiscent of the early 1800s when the hunt for blubber for lamp oil decimated
the whale population. In the mid-1900s the same fate greeted the Atlantic cod and herring
as well as California’s sardines, pushing all of these species to the brink of extinction.
By the late 20th century, these disruptions were no longer regional problems but became
global and catastrophic. At present, cod, a staple in the highly iconic English fish and chips,
is fast becoming scarce and the authorities are toying with the idea of strict rationing to
regulate fishing for global markets.
Today more than 70% of the species are being fished at or beyond sustainable capacity.
More than a decade ago, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN raised an alarm
about global stocks of fish, especially the commercial species4. Nonetheless, the spectacular
rates of exploitation have continued unabated so that:
•	 more than half of the fishing grounds in the world today are already in decline
•	 a quarter of the global fishing grounds are completely fished out commercially.
4.3.4	 HABITAT DESTRUCTION

The threat to the ecosystem has to do with its innate fragility. For instance, unsustainable
developments in aquaculture, tourism, transportation could easily wreck an ecosystem.
Biologists consider the chief proximate cause of ecosystem fragility to be:
•	 agricultural use that includes crops and grazing activity (e.g. slash-and-burn agriculture
in Madagascar, Indonesia and Brazil);
•	 surface mining causing pollution (e.g. air pollution dispersing nitrogen oxide, sulfer
dioxide which can alter the metabolism, fitness and mortality of flora and fauna)
•	 use of chemical herbicide and pesticide

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Nature and environment

•	 water pollution, air pollution and acid rain
•	 urban development and infrastructure: roads, power plants, desert solar arrays,
pipelines and transmission lines
•	 timber harvesting and deforestation
•	 introduction of invasive alien species nonnative to an ecosystem
Closely associated with the fragility of ecosystems is the harsh reality of what biologists
think of as habitat destruction which means:
•	 Rendering a natural habitat unsuitable for supporting the species dependent on it
•	 Driving animal species and organisms to extinction
•	 Reduction of biodiversity
Ultimately, an irresponsible use of ecosystem services could mean a steep loss in the economic
value of the environment. These days, the visible signs of stress to our ecosystems come
by way of:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

topsoil erosion causing land infertility and desertification
reduction in sustainable yields of fisheries, forests and other biotic resources
loss of pollinators (bees)
reduction in water quality due to sedimentation
loss of carbon storage capacity of the environment
reduction of surface water resources
loss of genetic material that provide medicinal value.

Not unexpectedly, all of these in turn have an extensive impact on biodiversity and weather
systems all over the world.

4.4	 WATER SCARCITY
There are critical linkages between water, health and ecosystems that we can ignore only at
our own peril. Here are a few sobering thoughts:
•	 Most of the earth’s surface is covered by water
•	 Most of the human body is composed of water
•	 More than a third of the world’s population lives around coastal ecosystems

Thanks to the increased economic growth triggered by globalization, freshwater consumption
has risen steeply in recent decades as the supplies of freshwater all around the globe have
begun to dwindle. Looking over the last hundred years, the following facts stand out:
•	 Growth in global freshwater consumption at a rate more than twice that of
population growth
•	 Worsening access to potable (i.e. safe to drink) water for nearly a fifth of the world
population
•	 greater vulnerability to waterborne diseases (e.g. cholera, E. Coli) among the
world’s poor
Somewhat surprisingly, mostly in developing countries, total freshwater withdrawals (both
surface and groundwater) are believed to have increased only marginally since the late
1980s, while in most developed countries, freshwater withdrawals have actually declined
or stabilized. This suggests:
•	 definite improvements in the efficiency of water use
•	 increased importation of water-intensive goods, in particular, food.

A 2014 United Nations World Water Development Report notes that groundwater supplies
are diminishing fast with an estimated 20% of the world’s aquifers being over-exploited,
some rather massively. This is not surprising since with the scale of globalization moving
into overdrive, the global demand for water withdrawals is projected to increase by more
than 50% by 2050.
There is every reason to anticipate significant growth all around the globe in
•	
•	
•	
•	

manufacturing industries
thermal power generation
commercial agriculture
expansive domestic use

However, the real challenge to usable water resources is compounded by:
•	 pollution degradation along with reduced retention of freshwater resources (e.g.
loss of wetlands)
•	 natural soils and detritus replaced with pervious soils and even pavement.
Most shockingly, nearly 800 million people around the globe continue to struggle without
access to an improved source of water. This combined with the fact that more than a third
of the global population continue to exist without access to improved sanitation pushes the
problem of water scarcity to a crisis level.
Therefore, globalization faces an ethical challenge given that nearly half of the global citizenry
is deprived of a fundamental human right to water while the essential linkages in ecosystems,
from waste disposal to protecting people from contaminated water resources continue to
be strained to a breaking point.
Unfortunately, the challenges created by global forces need to be addressed at the local level
for human survival depends on the intricate connections between basic hygiene, filtration
and storage practices, municipal sanitation and waste disposal systems. By the same token,
local resources may be simply inadequate to extend development priorities to include regular
monitoring of:
•	 water quality standards
•	 water-related disease indicators
•	 the long-term health of water resources.

4.5	BIOINVASIONS
Often enough, the emission of toxic waste as a byproduct of industrialization interferes with
the genetic makeup of plant life thereby producing results that are not always beneficial to
the sustained health of human life on earth.
Fast-paced industrialization has been known to create a few nasty surprises. On top of
the list should be the influx of invasive species that crop up as a reaction to the release of
pollutants and toxic substances into nature5.
•	 Note: Invasive species could be any plant or organism that has been introduced to
an environment in which it is not native. It can still take to the new surroundings
and spread fast, thereby crowding out native species and damaging the environment,
ecological balance and human health.
Invasive species are capable of bringing about a subtle form of habitat destruction as well.
Most often, flora or fauna introduced by humans tend to crowd out native species. Two
examples stand out:
•	 European settlement in the mid-1800s introduced exotic European and Asian grasses
that eventually destroyed the California coastal prairie
•	 Blooming pfiesteria in the Chesapeake Bay area as a natural adaptation to toxic
runoff from overactive commercial farming.
Believe it or not, in recent times, globalization has also facilitated an epidemic increase of
bioinvasions. The list of alien species stretches from exotic seeds (carried by hikers) to gypsy
moths and zebra mussels.
As the invaders quite successfully take to their new homes they are also capable of precipitating
unexpected health crises. Lately scientists have begun to cite bioinvasion as a major cause
of species extinction.
With the spectacular rise in global transport, billions of organisms are also on the move,
traveling thousands of miles concealed in cargo or lying low in the ballast of ships. They
may even be in our travel luggage or stick to our shoes or even cling to the sides of the
ships that criss-cross the global waters.
By far the most lethal aspect of globalization is the spread of living organisms that can
transmit infectious diseases between humans or from animals to humans. The 2009 pandemic
known as “swine flu” illustrated the potential for contagion as air travel helped to spread
the disease to numerous countries in record time.

Last but not least, the globalization of food supplies creates a huge potential for spreading
disease. Consider the spread of bacteria such as Salmonella and E.coli. The demand by
affluent nations for fresh fruits and seafood year-round means that these foods have to
be imported from foreign lands that do not necessarily follow the best health standards
concerning harvesting, storage, processing and transport of food.

4.6	 ECONOMIC EXTERNALITIES
As we have seen thus far, globalization impacts the balance between economic development
and the environment, one that is becoming increasingly precarious with every passing decade.
On the face of it, the relationship between globalization and the environment has two
essential dimensions:
•	 Demand side: population growth that creates an increased demand for essential
resources (e.g. demand for coal in China since 2001 when it joined the WTO and
became an active participant in global trade)
•	 Supply side: better technology that makes possible more efficient extraction and
on an ever-increasing scale (e.g. bottom trawling in fishing that cleans out marine
life from the ocean floor)

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Nature and environment

Inasmuch as globalization allows a free flow of information, culture and ideas along with
ever-newer technology, the changing scale and composition of demand have a sizeable
impact on the environment.
Let’s not forget that along with collapsing our sense of time and space, globalization
constantly fuels new fashions and fads. We could say that mass consumerism is the most
visible feature of demand that taxes local environmental resources.
On the supply side, technological progress makes possible very large increases in productivity
and supply. These in turn make possible large scale extractions of minerals and other resources
at greater speed and efficiency.
Consider for instance how commercial fishing trawlers are so effective at vacuuming fish
out of the ocean while threatening to deplete fish stocks to dangerous levels (e.g. Bluefin
tuna, Atlantic cod and halibut). This makes it impossible to ignore the tremendous power
of the global economy to:
•	 exploit nature that may actually exceed the innate capacity of the environment to
replenish and sustain itself
•	 generate globalized externalities that are seldom confined to national boundaries
Already the losses to fisheries and agricultural productivity have reached into the hundreds
of billions of dollars per year. In addition, the loss of topsoil and pollinators means:
•	 an alarming loss of food security for many hundreds of millions of people
•	 an escalation of food and water conflicts around the world
•	 a heightened risk of famines and warfare
Here it would be wise to remember that not only does globalization impact the environment
but the health of the environment in turn impacts on the pace, direction and quality of
globalization. This reinforces the idea that economy and ecology are not completely separate
entities nor can they operate independently of each other.
The tremendous consumption possibilities opened up by globalization bring in a whole host
of externalities or spillover effects that need to be properly accounted for.
•	 Note: Externality is the cost or benefit of an economic activity that is experienced
by an unrelated third party who did not choose to face such an outcome. A positive
externality means unintended positive benefits for all third parties while a negative
externality imposes unintended costs upon others.

A most common example of a negative externality is a manufacturing activity that produces
air or water pollution. In contrast, making improvements to one’s residential property is a
positive externality that may help improve the value of all the properties in the neighborhood.
The enormous push to modernize that accompanies globalization could take negative
externalities to an extreme level. Such is the fear of the Dongriya forest people of Orissa in
India. Their way of life is being threatened by a global mining company that wants to dip
into vast reserves of bauxite, the mineral from which we get aluminum6.
Often enough all it takes is to build modern roads into deep forests which is the surest way
to disrupt a tribal way of life, not to speak of destroying a forest habitat. It could be just
as devastating as the transmission of disease vectors and animal pathogens we saw earlier.
Irrespective of whether it is the risk of pandemics or irresponsible industrialization, the
negative externalities need to be monitored carefully to avoid the severely adverse economic
impact that could easily make an economy unravel without warning.

4.7	TRADEOFFS
All things considered, globalization provides an interesting platform on which to weigh the
question of preserving environmental health versus finding new ways to alleviate poverty
for broad swathes of humanity.
It is not so easy to strike a meaningful balance since environmental protection could easily
be a drag on economic growth in the short run, but adversely affect human well-being over
the long term.
As may be expected, compliance with strict environmental regulations could easily:
•	 drive up the operational costs of industries
•	 erode the competitive position of industries
•	 destroy the comparative advantage of nations in trade
In fact, environmental compliance might even force businesses to lose their competitive
position in global markets thereby adversely affecting the overall health of an economy.

However, environmental activists consider slower growth to be entirely worthwhile if that
means returning the environment to good health. But their detractors find it far better to:
•	 Rely on unrestricted market forces and technological advances to solve environmental
problems (e.g. sharing eco-friendly technology)
•	 Answer environmental challenges by lifting people out of poverty first before resorting
to greater regulation (e.g. growing environmental consciousness born of affluence).
After all, it cannot be denied that oppressive poverty in developing countries has been known
to cause serious environmental degradation. Often enough, traditional forms of agriculture
involve deforestation which could seriously ruin the rich biodiversity of rainforests (e.g. the
Brazilian Amazon).
Interestingly enough, free market advocates point to an environmental Kuznet’s curve
according to which globalization may at first worsen environmental health but not to the
point of no return. Eventually economic improvements and rising living standards could
lead to greater public awareness and restore the environment back to health7.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Nature and environment

As we can appreciate, there is no easy way to sort through the complex interconnections
between the environment and economic health and toward an easy resolution. Thus countries
invariably get entangled in a web of restrictions, threats and counter-threats which have to
be resolved sensibly.
The danger is, if countries begin to close down their borders one after the other then a
massive global economic slowdown is almost certain. Consequently, there is every reason to
avoid such a disaster by forging trade agreements as well as creating workable environmental
alliances. This also invites:
•	 Healthy sponsorship from MNCs that stand to win big and benefit handsomely
from environmental alliances.
•	 Organized campaigns to promote environmental awareness and responsible
management of the dwindling environmental resources.
In the end, it is worth remembering that there are very few instances when environmental
disasters may be contained within national boundaries. The implications could be quite
serious as has been seen from the:
•	 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Ukraine in 1986 causing uncontrolled release of
radioactive substances into the environment
•	 Japanese earthquake and tsunami of 2011 that caused the nuclear power plant at
Fukushima to buckle and release substantial amounts of radiation into the atmosphere

4.8	 MOUNTING INSECURITY
According to the United Nations there are several serious threats to human security and
well-being:
•	 Continual resource depletion
•	 Unmonitored environmental degradation
•	 climate change (global warming and water tables rising)
Either separately or in combination with many other factors, these developments could
be quite onerous when it comes to protecting lives, ensuring livelihoods and responsibly
managing ecosystems.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Nature and environment

As may be expected, most conflicts generally arise over the crucial questions of ownership,
management, allocation and control over scarce resources. From an economic viewpoint,
there are three main causes behind an increase in resource scarcity:
•	 Demand-induced scarcity: when existing supplies cannot meet demand (e.g. water
or cropland not meeting all local needs, population growth, new technologies or
increases in consumption needs per capita).
•	 Supply-induced scarcity: environmental degradation, pollution, natural variation
or breakdown in delivery infrastructure that threaten to interrupt a supply chain.
•	 Structural scarcity: when different groups in a society face unequal access to vital
resources (e.g. fresh water, cropland, grazing land). This may be due to established
cultural practices, gender dynamics, social and economic barriers.
Since local and national institutions often lack the capacity to resolve skirmishes and disputes
that may arise over the degradation or depletion of resources, violent conflicts are a definite
possibility. The situation worsens as:
•	 both populations and economic growth continue to increase in tandem
•	 there are ever-larger demands made for scarce resources, the extraction of which
pushes beyond the powers of natural renewability.
•	 national governments give up the power to manage and control local environments
in the face of demands from expanding global markets
Consequently, it is increasingly crucial that policymakers understand how to prevent conflicts
over natural resources, and how to contain and defuse such conflicts when they occur.
Not surprisingly, the stock of vital renewable resources is gradually becoming a predominant
concern in global policy deliberations. These involve:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

the availability of freshwater resources
ready access to fertile cropland
sufficient availability of rangeland
preserving the global stock of forests
the availability of fisheries and other wildlife.

Disputes over renewable resources are also becoming a regular feature of modern life as
social fissures and deepening rifts and resentment threaten to trigger widespread unrest
at every turn. Apart from negatively impacting on ecosystems, these can easily destabilize
livelihoods, and undermine peace and development.

Nature and environment

It may be foolhardy to imagine that technological progress is the answer to finding substitutes
for a ransacked environment or replenishing depleted reserves of natural resources. Thus
globalization creates a new urgency to address the social stresses that arise due to uneven
adaptations to the demands of global markets.
For starters, the tensions arising out of the scarcity of the life-giving environmental resources
should be allowed to define the future contours of globalization. Above all, we need to
devise social institutions that can balance our need for a satisfactory quality of life with
responsible environmental management.

4.9	SUSTAINABILITY
This brings us to the question of sustainability. The idea is intimately connected to the
simple principle that directly or indirectly, our survival and well-being depend critically on
the health of the natural environment.
The goal of sustainability is to create and maintain the conditions under which both humans
and nature can coexist in productive harmony and meet the social, cultural and economic
needs of present and future generations.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Nature and environment

The idea of sustainable development came out of numerous environmental movements
over the last couple of decades. Early on environmental activist groups such as Greenpeace
and Friends of the Earth pushed to introduce environmental issues into business and
government agendas.
This gradually shifted to the problem of sustainable development that focused on:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Climate change
Energy scarcity
Biodiversity loss
Water scarcity
Social justice

Thus sustainability may be best viewed as a mishmash of environmental, social and economic
issues. The fact that the scope of the problem has broadened over the last decade is an
indication of the growing stresses and strains underlying globalization.
The World Economic Forum (WEF), an international institution committed to improving the
state of the world through private-public cooperation, suggests that economic competitiveness
may increasingly be coming at the expense of social and environmental sustainability. Their
list of concerns includes:
•	 Rising unemployment rates in many advanced countries
•	 Rising income inequalities and social unrest in rapidly growing economies
•	 Increased pressure on natural resources and high levels of pollution
In response the WEF seeks to define a set of institutions, policies and factors that might
enable all members of a society to develop the best levels of health, participation and security.
While there is no way to deny the pressing need for sustainable development and growth all
around, the complexity of economic calculations often tends to overwhelm serious concerns
about environmental health and that must be avoided as best as possible.

4.10	 RENEWABLE RESOURCES
Clearly, the first step toward sustainable development must be to welcome the possibility
of generating more renewable resources. The U.S. currently relies heavily on coal, oil and
natural gas for its energy needs. With fossil fuels being essentially nonrenewable, their
supplies will eventually:
•	 move onto a path of fast decline
•	 become too expensive to access or extract
•	 cost too much in terms of environmental damage
Logically, it is not possible to discuss the issue of sustainability without factoring in renewable
resources and by far the most important piece of the puzzle is renewable energy. The U.S.
Energy Information Administration ranks renewables according to usage:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Biomass (use of plant matter and animal waste to create electricity)
Hydroelectric power (use of flowing water to move turbines to generate electricity)
Wind power (using wind to run turbines to generate electricity
Geothermal energy (using heated water and steam from the earth to run power stations)
Solar power (using photovoltaic panels, solar collectors and thin-film solar sheeting)

Unlike fossil fuels, the renewable resources are not depleted once harvested. Instead they
can be regenerated or replenished with careful management.
Wind power is one of the fastest-growing energy sources and at present it is also the least
expensive alternative fuel source available. By comparison solar power continues to be far
more expensive. While biomass in the form of wood once supplied most of U.S. energy
needs, today it supplies less than 10 percent of the total needs.
According to the World Water Assessment Project of the UN, hydroelectricity continues
to be by far the largest renewable source for power generation in the world. Its share in
total electricity generation is expected to remain around 15% all the way through 20358.
When we consider the global primary energy supply, less than 2% of it comes from renewable
resources at present. Given the existing stock of technological knowledge, these alternative
sources of energy are not very likely to grow fast enough to fill the fossil fuel gap any time
soon. Nevertheless, with the rising cost and decreasing availability of nonrenewable fossil
fuels, finding renewable resources is turning out to be a pressing imperative.

5	 WORK AND WAGES
5.1	INTRODUCTION
Critics of globalization often say that global economic integration tends to increase worker
insecurity. This is not least because financial capital can flit around the globe quite freely
but labor does not possess the same quality.
The advocates of globalization counter this view with the assertion that modern technology
is just as able to take work across national boundaries as to bring work to a willing worker.
Thanks to the internet and the telecommunications revolution, workers are now able to
telecommute which means being able to perform a task online without physically having
to travel to a job.
However, the debate does not end there. As globalization permits the offshoring and
outsourcing of labor, it also makes labor demand quite highly responsive to market forces.
This does not always translate into equitable pay or benefits across labor markets. Add to
this the resolute push for market flexibility all around and we can begin to see why workers
everywhere have begun to complain about rising uncertainty and insecurity.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Work and wages

In this section we shall look at the labor market issues a bit more closely. We shall begin
with the shift in economic sentiments in the 1970s and the structural changes that followed.
How these impacted the nature of work, labor standards, occupational composition and
income security will be considered next before concluding with the global outlook for labor.

5.2	 SHIFTING SENTIMENTS
It seems that by the end of the 1970s the global economic certainties that underscored the
golden age of capitalism after the end of WWII were gradually evaporating. The onslaught
of stagflation (see section 1.6.3) had a lot to do with it.
As it happens, economic policy direction soon turned to a reassessment of business priorities
and a reevaluation of the employment and wage-setting practices current at the time. With
inflation being a major concern in the capitalist world, it led to:
•	 Startling transformations in union contracts.
•	 well-publicized efforts by businesses to freeze wages or to install wage cuts.
On one side this meant a push to cut production costs and a simultaneous effort to expand
markets on the other. Since business expansion ordinarily depends on easily available credit
and the latter in turn depends on the expected profit picture of a business, a fervent search
for cheaper resources around the globe combined with a call for integrated capital markets.
Together these renewed the impetus for globalization.
Understandably, flexibility became a byline for globalization which meant:
•	 a systematic deinstitutionalization of labor (e.g. dismantling unions)
•	 deregulation of finance (e.g. lifting depression era banking rules)
This suggests that the playing field was not quite even from the start. After all, financial
capital is inherently more mobile and flexible; it can traverse the globe at the speed of light
but the same cannot be said about labor. Not surprisingly, labor market flexibility often
means that:
•	 employers need not be stationary entities confined to national boundaries
•	 employers are no longer bound by past obligations to their workers
•	 past labor standards could be relaxed citing the pressure of global market competition

Thus globalization introduced significant changes in the structural mechanics of labor
markets1. At a mundane level, this meant significant changes in the relative demand for:
•	 different kinds of labor (e.g. manual versus analytical)
•	 different types of skills (e.g. mechanical versus tech-savvy)
•	 different types of capital (i.e. various types of techniques and technologies used
in production)

5.3	 TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE
From an economic perspective, the labor-abundant countries have a comparative advantage
in producing labor-intensive goods while the labor-scarce countries have an advantage in
producing technology-intensive goods.
Ever since the labor-abundant countries (e.g. India and China) joined the global marketplace
the prices of consumer electronics (e.g. DVD players), apparel and the cost of call center
operations began to come down. On the flip side this also made global labor demand more
price-sensitive.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Work and wages

A topic that regularly comes up for discussion is that of the import and export of work.
Inasmuch as, globalization has made work into a tradable commodity that is perpetually
chasing international price signals, a lot of globally connected businesses are now able to:
•	 Import work that was traditionally considered untradeable (e.g. call center operations,
software programming, back office tasks).
•	 Export work which is popularly goes under the labels of outsourcing and off-shoring.
Thanks to information technology, very few sectors can ignore the shifting currents of economic
advantage any longer. Even service-sector jobs are no longer immune from offshoring.
Ideally, technological change should be factor-neutral in the sense that it should impact
on all factors of production to an equal degree. However, that simple rule does not quite
hold in our information age.
The information technologies happen to be quite partial to skilled labor. Consequently,
some people may simply be lucky enough to work with technology while others are easily
replaced by it. In the economic literature this is known as a skill-biased technological change.
•	 Note: Skill-biased technological change is a shift in production technology that
favors skilled over unskilled labor. This increases the relative productivity of skilled
workers thereby increasing their relative demand and wages.
To be sure, the information age has also brought about significant changes in the nature of
work. This may be best summed up in terms of three visible trends:
•	 Virtualization
•	 Fragmentation
•	 Casualization
Virtualization refers to a shift from physical work to more mental duties. This suggests
that the average worker nowadays is expected to handle more information. By the same
token, many are also able to work from home which causes the least bit of disruption to
their lifestyle.
However, while not all workers may be lucky enough to benefit from virtualization, it brings
clear changes in the organization of work. Most significantly, with the onset of the digital
revolution that serves as the backbone of the entire information industry, what has ensued
is a fragmentation of tasks which can then be distributed to various points of production
around the globe.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Work and wages

In effect, fragmentation means:
•	 intricate divisions of labor within tasks and occupations
•	 changes in the organizational structure and styles of management
•	 changes in the demand for occupational skills.
Thanks to the steady advancement of information technology there have also been two
further changes in the institutional makeup of work:
•	 The traditional fixed work contracts have been replaced by more flexible work
arrangements.
•	 Life-long employment policies have also been gradually phased out in favor of
temporary work contracts.
This transformation is often referred to as casualization inasmuch as labor contracts no longer
have the traditional safety clauses that once protected employees against summary dismissal.
Not surprisingly, in recent decades, the developed market economies of the world have seen
a tremendous surge in:
•	 part-time employment
•	 perma-temps who are locked in a world of temporary jobs
•	 placement agencies that specialize in matching temporary work with job-seekers
In many ways, these adaptations are the flip side of the stiff barriers that continue to restrict
the mobility of humans across national borders. Despite our familiarity with Indian software
engineers in Silicon Valley, Central American fruit pickers on the west coast of the U.S.
and Filipina maids in the Persian Gulf countries, therefore, the labor markets around the
world may still be seen as an unexploited frontier of globalization.

5.4	 LABOR MARKETS
When it comes to the globalized labor market, three features readily stand out:
•	 An enlarged labor supply
•	 A price-responsive labor demand
•	 An Enhanced skills premium

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Work and wages

The most obvious advantage of globalization is the creation of a huge pool of labor.
Advancing technology makes this pool increasingly accessible to business interests. Likewise
any economy opening up to foreign trade and investment also makes the demand for labor
more price-responsive.
Much of this is because integrated markets make the demand for tradable products more
responsive to price changes. In the same fashion, the demand for labor also becomes more
sensitive to changes in its cost. This means growing flexibility in:
•	 wages and benefits (e.g. retirement and pensions)
•	 labor standards (e.g. working conditions)
•	 government regulations (e.g. severance pay)
As may be expected, all of these are important facets in the collective push for labor market
flexibility.
•	 Note: Labor market flexibility essentially means that both employers (who buy
foreign labor) and consumers (who buy foreign products) are able to substitute
foreign workers for domestic workers more easily.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Work and wages

When it comes to labor costs, therefore, the comparative advantage of a nation in global
markets depends on:
•	 The relative price of skilled versus unskilled labor
•	 The size of the market that the key businesses operates in
•	 The institutions that govern labor markets (e.g. unions, labor standards etc.)
Since the developing countries tend to rely on an abundance of low-skilled labor in their
export industries and do not always have stringent labor standards, they could easily compete
against low-skilled labor-intensive production in the advanced nations.
Not surprisingly, most experts discover that an increased exposure to trade with low-income
countries widens the skills premium in the advanced countries.
Note: Skill premium is the difference between the wage of skilled labor and that earned by
the unskilled. In developed nations it is measured by taking the wage difference between
college-educated and those with only a high school degree
Beginning about 1980 the skills premium began to rise in all nations of the OECD; this
is widely seen to be due in part to globalization and the ongoing technological change.

5.5	 LABOR STANDARDS
Orthodox economic theory maintains that wages and earnings are governed strictly by
worker productivity. But since markets are not perfectly competitive as economic theory
assumes, there are other factors to consider such as:
•	 The scope of occupational regulations
•	 Rules governing the level of unionization
•	 Rules that relate to the bargaining rights of workers
As may be imagined, the economic value of human labor is closely governed by the political
and social institutions of a country. Thus the political history, cultural mores and traditions
of a country may be seen to influence the value of human labor as much as if not more
than productivity.

All the advanced economies of the world have detailed regulations that govern employment
practices. These are primarily meant to set the terms for the:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Eligibility to work in a country
Minimum wage standards
Acceptability of nature of work
The maximum hours of work
The mandatory worker benefits
The conditions of employment
The Freedom to unionize
Rules for collective bargaining
Rules for severance of employment contracts

It is the global depression of the 1930s that brought in elaborate rules and regulations to
govern work and labor in the advanced capitalist economies of the world. However, with
the speeding up of globalization in recent decades, some of those long held rules have been
relaxed or circumvented.
From the point of view of business profitability, the sources of labor overseas often have a
distinct advantage over the domestic markets in that:
•	 They may not be governed by the same type of work rules (e.g. employment of
child labor
•	 They may not have the same rules regarding working conditions (e.g. worker safety
or health requirements)
•	 They may not have the same type of environmental regulations in place (e.g. housing
conditions and living standards)
These aberrations offer tremendous cost advantages for multinational corporations since
bypassing labor regulations could help to cultivate competitive advantage.
In the extreme case, the labor standards in various countries could easily be pitched into a
competitive struggle for attracting business interests and capital investment. This has gained
popularity as:
•	 Note: Regulatory arbitrage is defined as a practice used by firms to circumvent
unfavorable regulation. This is often done by restructuring transactions, creative
financial engineering and geographical relocation designed to play the regulations
or their absence to one’s advantage.

A question that arises time and again is whether there should not be common labor standards
across the board since work continues to be priced in global markets. But this invariably
comes up against the foundational notion of comparative advantage as well as the deeper
question of what really constitutes free trade. As yet, there are no easy answers.

5.6	 OCCUPATIONAL TRENDS
As it happens, the significant occupational growth areas today are in healthcare, business
management, computing, food service and personal care. This is not an accident since
advancing technology continues to direct workers away from traditional manufacturing
and into service occupations.
Unfortunately, the salaries for many fast-growing occupations are also lower than those that
they are replacing. This is primarily due to:
•	 increased competition for service sector jobs
•	 limited opportunities for career advancement in most of service sector jobs
Given that any task that can be encrypted and digitized could easily be shipped overseas means
that the service sector jobs are not totally immune from the great advances in technology.

By most accounts there has been a steep loss of clerical jobs in the US since 2007; this is
the result of new technologies continuing to replace office workers. The report connects
this to falling median household incomes and growing income inequality.

the clerical jobs on the retrenchment list:

Retail cashiers being replaced by internet shopping and self-checkout systems

Since about mid-1970s, the labor markets in the U.S. and Western Europe have not done
so well for lower-skilled and unskilled workers. This problem has manifested itself in several
different ways:
•	
•	
•	
•	

Growing wage premium for skilled workers
Erosion of real earnings of the low-skilled
Growing volatility in earnings and hours worked
Growing economic inequality across skills groups

Overall, neither the US nor Western Europe may be credited with keeping up a steady pace
of job creation at decent wages. We could even say that the labor markets in the advanced
global economies have been in a troubled state for quite some time and there is every reason
to believe there is more turbulence ahead.

5.7	 UNEVEN DEVELOPMENTS
As may be gathered thus far, the relationship between globalization and labor is tenuous at
best2. This is best illustrated by the proliferation of:
•	 Uneven employment relationships
•	 Labor market segmentation
•	 Human trafficking

5.7.1	 EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS

One of the most visible signs of uneven development triggered by globalization is the tilting
of domestic manufacturing production in the developed nations away from labor-intensive
industries such as apparel toward more professional-intensive industries such as, aircraft.
For low-skilled labor, this type of a shift in direction presents a double whammy:
•	 a reduction in demand bolstered by global competition
•	 an increased sensitivity of employers to wage costs due to the ease of substituting
labor across national borders
To add to it, the employment relationships are made even more uncertain by the unpredictable
fluctuations in the:
•	 production costs other than labor
•	 predictability of hours worked
•	 bargaining power of workers
Among the changing employment relationships brought about by globalization, perhaps
the most noticeable is the constant threat of downsizing of businesses in response to the
changing winds of global competition. Not surprisingly, the cost of adjusting to the sudden
shifts in direction is pushed almost entirely in the direction of the worker.
It seems as though downsizing has become a constant feature of global competition. While
clear links may not be established between this structural change and the openness to trade,
it is hard to deny that over the last three decades there has been:
•	
•	
•	
•	

greater inequalities within and across skills categories
greater instability in wages and employment
greater competition in product markets
increased churning in labor markets exerts downward pressure on wages

These speak to the restrictive patterns of wage negotiations precipitated by the trade winds
of globalization. Thus wages may very well continue to wobble in competitive markets even
in the face of shrinking trade imbalances. Not surprisingly, these only add to the perceptions
of growing insecurity for broad sections of the global workforce.

While the monetary gains reaped by the professionals and high-skilled may very well
outweigh the losses of the non-professional or unskilled workers, it makes for a decidedly
uneven economic landscape which does not carry happy portents about out economic future.
It is almost too easy to shrug off all of it as merely due to a skills gap but it has broader
implications by way of:
•	 increasing dispersion of earnings among the low-skilled
•	 increasing volatility of wages and hours worked which reduce the ability to absorb
market shocks
•	 corroding social harmony and contributing to social pathologies
In the long run, all of these untoward developments could impair the effective demand for
goods and services in advanced nations thereby compromising the health and security of
the global economy.

5.7.2	 MARKET SEGMENTATION

As it happens, labor markets are quite segmented internationally than might appear at first
flush. This accounts for the tremendous wage disparities across national borders. While this
may mean comparative advantage for developing nations, segmented markets could easily
prove to be a drag on global economic health as well.
The prominent factors behind the segmented labor markets are:
•	 The restrictive visa policies of the develop nations that prevent workers from poor
countries from gaining ready access to their lucrative job markets.
•	 The preference of the developed world for highly skilled and well-educated workers
from abroad which automatically eliminates the poor from the economic race
An added problem with segmented labor markets is the decline in unionization which has
been particularly dramatic in the US and the UK. This is largely responsible for the growing
wage disparity between the skilled and unskilled in the US and UK over time.
By comparison, unions have remained fairly strong in Western Europe so that the wages
of the less skilled have not collapsed so completely. When it comes to the unemployment
rate however, the US and UK have fared much better than Western Europe over the last
decade or so.
5.7.3	 HUMAN TRAFFICKING

The International Labor Organization (ILO), created as a specialized agency of the UN in
1946 notes a sense of desperation in broad swathes of the global population amid an otherwise
robust global dynamic. Perhaps the most visible expression of it is human trafficking.
There are two prominent elements that play in human trafficking:
•	 use of threat or abduction, force, fraud, deception or coercion to recruit, transport
and transfer persons across national borders
•	 unlawful payments extracted with the promise of a better life
•	 clear intent of unlawful exploitation of those who are vulnerable.
The ILO estimates that at any point in time there are around three out of every 1000 persons
worldwide who are either involved in forced labor or subjected to human trafficking3.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Work and wages

Oftentimes innocuous job advertisements lure the vulnerable to the lair of unscrupulous
traffickers. The root causes of this problem are:
•	 Abysmal poverty in various parts of the world made worse by growing populations
•	 Absence of plentiful employment opportunities in developing countries
•	 Inefficient labor migration networks throughout global markets
Inasmuch as improved modes of transportation and communication have made possible a
shrinking world, it should be expected that these also create greater chances of migration,
both voluntary and coerced.
The ILO contends that human trafficking is a hugely profitable business and expects it to
thrive so long as there remains:
•	 Stubborn pockets of poverty untouched by bigger policy shifts
•	 Disintegrating communities and support networks that create social redundancy
•	 Broad swathes of homeless people across the world
While human trafficking may border on slavery it would be a mistake to think of it simply
as an outcome of globalization. Instead it is an integral part of the globalization process
itself. This is largely due to
•	 the overt push for integrated labor markets
•	 accepted disruptions to settled lives and livelihoods
•	 proliferation of workshops and factories in developing countries that serve as newer
avenues of exploitation for displaced labor
We should therefore agree that the push to integrate labor markets worldwide is not without
steep costs, the impact of which is not always balanced or even. Ironically, the internet
that serves as an iconic symbol of globalization works incredibly well in facilitating and
furthering the exploitation and trafficking of individuals.
As is gradually becoming clear, the internet could be used not just for sharing information
but as:
•	 A prized tool of misinformation or disinformation
•	 A great tool of recruitment for purposes of economic exploitation

Work and wages

Clearly, the existing barriers to migration worsen the problem of exploitation of labor but
very few free trade advocates would go so far as to propose a complete elimination of all
barriers to migration in the name of economic freedom.
This is not only because the carefully cultivated strategies of comparative advantages might
be lost in the process but also that it would also fritter away the chances of economic
development for a nation that wishes to advance through globalized markets.

5.8	 RACE TO THE BOTTOM
The race-to-the-bottom argument is heard a lot these days. It refers to the notion that workers
in the North (affluent nations) have to give in to labor standards that are low enough to
prevent employers and capital to take flight in favor of the South (developing nations).
One of the key problems with globalization is that:
•	 the benefits may be huge but diffuse (e.g. lower prices for foreign imports)
•	 the costs, arguably smaller by comparison, are relatively concentrated (e.g. cheaper
imports displacing domestic production and workers)

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Consequently, the losses from globalization may be more acute than the gains from it. More
often than not, the losses are almost imperceptible as:
•	 a gradual watering down of labor standards
•	 a gradual erosion of pay and benefits
•	 a slow easing up of firm labor contracts
The truth of the matter is, nations that wish to maintain higher labor standards can simply
maintain them at a higher cost irrespective of what their trading partners are doing in the
world. Nevertheless, given the price-sensitive nature of labor demand noted earlier, any
attempt to raise labor standards usually risks steep job losses.
This is not to say that there are no clever modes of adapting to the higher cost. Consider
for instance:
•	 Using currency devaluation which can reduce domestic costs thereby improving
competitiveness
•	 Adjusting wages downward as compensation for staying with higher standards than
elsewhere
•	 Letting taxes in the country go up so as to pay for the cost of higher labor standards
Most noticeably, none of these promise long-term economic betterment for a majority of
the citizenry. In the end, anything having to do with the condition of labor or the mobility
of capital has to be addressed from a collective viewpoint. Unfortunately, globalization also
makes it increasingly hard for workers to force others in society to bear a fair share of their
economic cost of adjustment.
One might even say that globalization tends to blur the idea of collective purpose. Whether
it be through currency devaluation, taxation or wage cuts, it is very likely that the workers
ultimately are forced to bear the brunt of the costs of adjustment. Ironically, the more
responsive the demand for labor to global market forces, easier it is for employers to unburden
a whole host of costs in the direction of the workers. This is the crux of the race-to-the
bottom argument (see Rodrik 2011).

5.9	RESHORING
Back in the 1990s activists worldwide sharply protested actions by the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund for all the economic imbalances that had resulted in the wake
of globalization. The fear was all too palpable back then about:
•	 Steep losses of manufacturing jobs in the developed world
•	 an imminent dismantling of the middle class.
Encouragingly enough, the tide appears to be turning of late. Thus some segments of
manufacturing, admittedly the upper end of highly technology-incentive processes, have
begun to gradually come back on shore, in both the UK and the US.
American corporations that once offshored manufacturing to China, a process that went on
for two long decades, have slowly begun to bring jobs home. Most notable in that group
are Apple, Motorola, General Electric and Ford.
It may well be that globalization has advanced to the point that the cost of labor between
the developed nations and some emerging markets has begun to converge. Evidently, the
outsourcing destinations of yesteryears are not cheaper any more so that with the erosion
of cost advantage, the companies are slowly coming back home.
In many industries, including computers and electronics, machinery, appliances, electrical
equipment and furniture, the cost of manufacturing in certain parts of America exclusively
for the American market is much the same as producing in China4. This calculation is
based on:
•	 Direct cost of labor, property and transport
•	 Indirect cost of supply-chain risks (due to geopolitical uncertainties)
It is also said that the labor markets overseas may be getting overstretched in the sense that:
•	 the overseas supply of high-quality labor may be just about exhausted (e.g. in China).
•	 the pay for senior management for several emerging markets (e.g. China, Turkey
and Brazil) either matches or has begun to exceed that in America and Europe.
There is also something to be said about geographical proximity. These days, Mexico is
proving to be an attractive destination for a lot of foreign businesses. Chrysler has begun to
use Mexico as a base for shipping cars to Southeast Asia while the country is also turning
out to be a hub for the aerospace industry.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Work and wages

Furthermore, the proximity of Mexico to the giant markets in Canada and the U.S. provides
a huge advantage in terms of having to deal with fewer uncertainties or interruptions to
the supply chains.
Thus the factors that have begun to help with onshoring or reshoring of jobs5 in the U.S.
as well may be seen as:
•	 Rising labor costs and overstretched skilled labor markets overseas
•	 Malleable labor (e.g. ease of wage-setting, hiring and firing decisions) due to
prolonged periods of high unemployment
•	 Transportation costs have begun to rise, making the cost of extending the global
reach of production less attractive
•	 Steadily falling price of energy due to discovery of new sources
•	 Advent of new technology (e.g. robotics) that promises to substantially reduce the
use human labor in production processes
On a not so attractive note, high unemployment over an extended period also makes the
labor force more flexible so that higher productivity can be extracted at lower pay. This is
especially true in the southern part of the U.S. where union presence is rather weak and
the labor force is more malleable to the terms of employment.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Work and wages

These days, while labor cost may have come under control, the cost of shipping has become
one of the most serious impediments to globalized production. This is due to:
•	 the problem of rising customs duties and other fees
•	 tying up enormous amounts of time in shipping over huge distances and unwanted
time lag between manufacturing and design
•	 Inevitable delays in introducing useful innovations and improvements in production
A more recent advantage for the U.S. in reshoring has to do with the falling price of energy.
The successful extraction of shale gas has made a large contribution toward lowering the
price of energy significantly which has begun to drive down the cost of manufacturing in
the U.S. substantially.
It is expected that over the long term, reshoring will also receive a huge boost from advanced
manufacturing techniques bringing in far less labor-intensive processes. The two most visible
features of this transformation are:
•	 3-D printing
•	 Robotics
The cutting-edge method of 3-D printing allows individual machines to build products by
simply depositing layer upon layer of material instead of having to assemble components
from scratch. This highly innovative process is already being used across research departments
and factories.
One day, it is hoped, 3-D printing might even completely replace assembly by hand (e.g.
3-D printed lighting for interactive toys as are being developed by Disney). Nonetheless,
this could also be seen as an advancing process by which the skills of labor are simplified
even further.
The same may be said about robotics, thanks to which, the share of labor in the total cost
of production is also falling steeply. Being cheaper, user-friendly and very predictable, robots
are fast being adopted by factories all around the world.
Given that the cost of robots does not vary too much irrespective of whether they are used
in America or in China, there is an obvious attraction to using them. This coupled with the
fact that the cost of a robot has also fallen 40 to 50% in many advanced economies since
the 1990s, along with robots becoming both safe and simple, the need for skilled labor in
manufacturing may also not be as critical in future.

5.10	 GLOBAL OUTLOOK
Evidently, broad segments of the global labor market seem to be trapped in a very uneven
and fragile situation. In many ways the U.S. economy is representative of the economic
stress lines that are increasingly becoming visible worldwide:
•	 routine transaction and production jobs that may be scripted and automated
continue to disappear
•	 mismatches in skills and education between workers and jobs continue to grow
These factors are contributing to jobless economic recoveries and sluggish recessions. The
situation is made worse by other signs of imbalance:
•	 The pace of job creation continues to fall short of the growth in jobseekers
•	 A serious delinking of productivity and wages that leads to stagnant earnings
•	 Significant increase in vulnerable employment, self-employment and informal
employment
•	 A progressive lengthening of unemployment spells eroding employment prospects
•	 Growing numbers of discouraged workers leaving the labor force
•	 A growing incidence of youth unemployment which threatens social order
The ILO examines labor issues around the world with a special focus on social justice. The
organization aims to:
•	
•	
•	
•	

Promote labor rights at work
Encourage decent employment opportunities
Enhance social protection for labor
Strengthen dialog on work-related issues

According to the ILO, the global economy needs more than 42 million jobs each year to
meet the growing number of new entrants into the labor market. However, lately the global
economy has been able to create only 40 million new jobs every year.
Consequently, the incidence of unemployment is likely to remain high, especially in the
East Asian and South Asian regions which together represent close to half of the additional
jobseekers. A particular problem is youth unemployment which continues to be almost three
times as high as the adult unemployment rate.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Work and wages

The youth-to-adult unemployment has reached a historic high in the Middle East and North
Africa as well as in parts of the Caribbean and Southern Europe. This could prove to be
hugely disruptive of social order in the long run.
The two most visible stress signs on the global front are that:
•	 small scale enterprises are continuing to find it difficult to access credit since the
2008 crisis
•	 there may still be too many uncertainties that are likely to impede hiring decisions
for years to come
•	 productivity gains translate into tangible wages at a very slow pace
•	 technological advancement has been extremely effective in combining expanding
markets with an improved ability to hold down wages
•	 little is being done to prevent a reemergence of financial bubbles
Thus it is not surprising that globally there is:
•	 A failure to check the growing incidence of working poverty
•	 A failure to check the expanding scale of informal jobs and undeclared work

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Work and wages

Even in the advanced nations, working poverty remains a serious problem since even working
full time at low wage jobs does not create enough of a living wage. Consider for instance
that low-wage workers at Walmart, the biggest employer in the U.S. if not the world, qualify
for public assistance, that ranges from food stamps and Medicaid to subsidized housing6.
The significant increase worldwide in vulnerable employment or self-employment should be
cause enough for alarm. With informal employment being widespread in most developing
countries it is increasingly difficult to combat poverty, especially in developing nations.
In addition, the total absence or a steady weakening of protective social safety nets continues
the make the situation worse. The growing problem of discouraged workers is only a
symptom of a deeper malaise.
In the case of the advanced nations, so long as recovery remains weak, the average
unemployment spell continues to last longer. This is especially true of the recent crisis areas
in the eurozone (e.g. Greece, Portugal and Spain).
Weak job creation over the long term could easily short-circuit the globalization dynamic by:
•	 draining the public purse thereby contributing to higher fiscal deficits
•	 promoting a loss of skills on the part of the unemployed which dims their
employment prospects further
These are indeed disturbing portents that explain why the ILO fears that the global economy
may be on an uncertain footing that promises lackluster performance for the foreseeable future.
Questions
1.	 Explain why some economists consider the labor market to be the last unexplored
frontier of globalization. Why do policymakers refuse to fully integrate labor markets?
2.	 What is skill-biased technological change? What does it have to do with the growing
incidence of inequality in the developed world?
3.	 The visible inequality in income that has greeted most of the industrialized nations
of the world may not be exclusively due to globalization. Do you agree? Why or
why not?
4.	 Could we say that when it comes to market integration capital has a distinct
advantage over labor? Why or why not?
5.	 Why is it that labor in the developed nations of the world is reluctant to embrace
globalization? Cite at least three valid reasons.

6.	 It is often said that globalization allows businesses to play regulatory arbitrage in
the sense of playing the different regulatory environments across countries to their
advantage. Could the same be said about labor standards? Why or why not?
7.	 What are the reasons behind the recent signs of the reshoring of jobs into the U.S.?
Are these only temporary changes or likely to last for a long time?
8.	 Explain how technology can play on both sides of the labor market in the sense of
creating jobs as well as destroying them. Can globalization be expected to strike a
meaningful balance between the two forces? Why or why not?
9.	 Why does the ILO consider the global outlook on unemployment to be so gloomy?
Are these connected to the structural changes brought about by technological progress?
10.	Is there some kind of connection between globalization and wage stagnation that
most commentators find to be detrimental to the health of labor in most market
economies? Explain.

6	 FINANCE AND INVESTMENT
6.1	INTRODUCTION
Finance and investment are two different entities altogether. In general, finance involves
raising funds to start and operate a business but often it also refers to a complex relationship
between the owners of a business (e.g. stockholders) and its lenders (e.g. banks).
Thus financing activity could involve:
•	
•	
•	
•	

Floating new stocks
paying dividends on existing shares
issuing new securities (bonds)
repaying debt to banks and other creditors

In contrast, investment involves the actual enlargement of the scale and scope of business
interests. This involves buying and selling of business assets as well as making and
collecting loans.
For the most part, finance is the mechanism by which the surplus savings generated in an
economy is channeled toward profitable investment opportunities. However, on the global
front, finance is by far the most important facilitator. It is the engine that drives the global
economy so that the more flexible and responsive a financial system, the better an economy
is able to function over time.
As we noted earlier, in recent decades financial globalization has proceeded at a much faster
pace than trade globalization. This is not least because money is able to flit around the
globe at much greater speeds than ever before.
This chapter deals with the crucial links between finance and investment, the nature of
integrated financial markets, the nature of global investments, the benefits and risks in the
dynamics of globalization and the ongoing challenges it presents.

6.2	 GLOBALIZED FINANCE
Once upon a time, a manufacturer building a new factory would be restricted to borrowing
from a domestic bank. These days there are many more options available. The manufacturer
can shop around the world for:
•	
•	
•	
•	

better interest rates at which to borrow
borrow in a foreign currency if that is more advantageous
issue stocks or bonds in either domestic or international markets
buy financial contracts at home or abroad to hedge against possible investment risks

As we noted in section 2.6, financialization is a key feature of globally integrated markets.
•	 Note: Financialization refers to the growth in the size and importance of a country’s
financial sector as a share of the overall GDP. It indicates the prominence of financial
markets and institutions in the global economy.
There are various forces behind the globalization of finance. The IMF identifies four
primary factors1:
•	
•	
•	
•	

advances in information and computer technologies
production, consumption and investment activities skipping national boundaries
liberalization of national financial and capital markets (e.g. relaxation of regulation)
increased competition among providers of financial services (e.g. hedge funds)

While the facilities for collecting and processing information have improved tremendously,
there have been vast improvements in the ways to measure, monitor and manage financial
risk as well.
The enhanced ability of market players to price and trade complex financial instruments (e.g.
derivatives) has meant a surge in financial innovations that has in turn caused a tremendous
growth in cross-border movements in financial capital.
As a result of all these innovative changes, the structure of global capital markets has
undergone dramatic transformations. It is well worthwhile to ponder the following:
•	 Old fashioned bank loans and deposits have been replaced by tradable securities.
•	 There is greater competition from nonbank financial institutions (e.g. pension funds)
•	 Relaxed regulatory barriers now allow commercial banks to diversify revenue sources
(e.g. take up investment banking activities, asset management and insurance)

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Finance and investment

All of this has meant a definite shift away from industrial capitalism to financial capitalism for
most market economies of the world. Since the 1980s, the U.S. has been at the forefront of
the financialization of the advanced economies. This has brought about significant growth in:
•	
•	
•	
•	

Both commercial and investment banking
financial asset management the global investor
personal and institutional insurance services
venture capital availability (e.g. for business startups)

While the developed nations of the world have long been stalwart supporters of financial
integration, the developing countries have begun to open up their financial systems to global
interests only since the 1990s. The outcome has been a tremendous increase in cross-border
linkages in the international investment positions of prominent global investors2.
Unfortunately, with financial markets becoming more competitive, the profit margins of
conventional banks have been squeezed considerably. As a result the commercial banks have
been forced to look for alternative sources of revenue and to diversify their investment holdings.
This has led to a wave of consolidations in the financial industry. Although there has been
relatively little consolidation of financial institutions in continental Europe, a lot of banks
in North America and the UK have been very successful in:
•	 merging with other banks
•	 merging with securities and insurance firms (e.g. Citigroup)
This has made the emerging institutions big enough to compete in global markets, permitting
both economies of scale and improved market shares. Going by asset size, China dominates
the list of the biggest 25 banks around the globe followed by the U.S. and the U.K.
This in itself is a testimony to China’s vigorous economic growth over the last decade and
robust trading position in the global marketplace.

6.3	 FINANCIAL MARKETS
Financial markets are where buyers and sellers come together to trade financial assets such
as stocks, bonds, commodities, derivatives (e.g. options and futures) and currencies. These
are of tremendous importance when it comes to:
•	
•	
•	
•	

setting prices and interest rates for global trade
raising financial capital for short and long term needs of businesses
transferring liquidity from net savers to net investors in global markets
transferring risk from the risk-averse to those who are risk-takers

The two most commonly used segments of financial markets are the money market and
the capital market.

6.3.1	 MONEY MARKET

Money markets deal with assets that have maturities of up to one year. The choice assets
in this category are:
•	 U.S. Treasury bills (e.g. with 3-month or 6-month maturities)
•	 negotiable certificates of deposit that may be traded in secondary markets
•	 repurchase agreements (backed by securities) offered by banks and other financial
institutions
•	 collateral loans and short term bills of exchange
The institutions that regularly operate in money markets are central banks, commercial
banks and other financial institutions.
Given the short-term characteristics of the money market assets, they are ideal as a temporary
place to park one’s funds. The two key advantages of money markets are:
•	 Liquidity: money market assets could be readily converted into cash.
•	 Safety: money market assets tend to be relatively safe
The availability of money market assets helps with the operating expenses of businesses and
providing working capital both to companies as well as the government.
Often enough older individuals living on fixed incomes rely on money market funds just
because of the safety associated with these types of investments along with ready liquidity
(i.e. convertibility into cash).
However, money market funds are not appropriate when it comes to undertaking long
term projects or making capital improvements. For that we need to look at capital markets.
6.3.2	 CAPITAL MARKETS

Capital markets deal with long term assets that last for more than a year. In the dynamics
of globalization, they play a critical role in directing a whole range of investment decisions
such as:
•	
•

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Finance and investment

The size of the capital markets in a nation is directly related to the:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Size of the national economy.
Available infrastructure, resource availability and workforce skills
Local business climate
Regulatory environment
Degree of political and economic stability
Openness to regional and international trade

As we noted in chapter 1, globalization relies on integrated markets in labor, resources and
finance. Economists generally agree that open capital markets help with:
•	
•	
•	
•	

Optimal resource allocation across nations
Optimizing market decisions over time
Enabling international investors with portfolio diversification
Imposing discipline on policy makers through price signals (e.g. interest rates)

Capital markets are an effective conduit for channeling the wealth of net savers to those
who need investible funds for long-term productive use.
The suppliers of financial capital in the global markets are:
•	 Retail investors (e.g. individuals)
•	 Institutional investors (e.g. pension funds and mutual funds)
In contrast, the demanders in the capital markets are usually:
•	 Municipalities and other governments
•	 Companies and organizations
•	 Banks and financial institutions
As may be expected, the suppliers of financial capital seek the maximum possible return
for their money at lowest possible risk while the users of their funds seek to raise capital
at the lowest possible cost.

6.4	 INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT
Over the past several decades foreign investment has grown at a significantly more rapid
pace compared to either global trade or even global production. International investment
happens to be a very powerful force as it involves expenditures on capital goods like tractors
and machinery, as well as infrastructure (e.g. roadways and power plants) and superstructures
(e.g. convention centers). These are all directed toward productive capacity thereby helping
to enlarge it for the future.
Investment initiatives are very important in bringing about closer economic integration in
the world. This is because investments are capable of altering entire methods of production
through the:
•	 Transfers of knowledge
•	 Transfer of technology
•	 Dissemination of management techniques

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Finance and investment

As productive capacities are enhanced all around, living standards are expected to improve
as well. There is therefore good reason for supporting companies that choose to invest
overseas. Thus corporate foreign investments are fueled by a need for:
•	 Bigger markets: Seeking to expand markets in general (due to saturated domestic
markets or gaining a competitive edge overseas)
•	 Large resource pools: a foreign facility or subsidiary of a company may have easier
access to the needed resources for production
In addition, there are several avenues for making clear efficiency gains for businesses. Three
possibilities readily come to mind:
•	 Network efficiency: global markets open up possibilities for establishing new
distribution networks and lucrative supply chain arrangements.
•	 Trading efficiency: MNCs often seek to reorganize production so as to take full
advantage of changing trade agreements or currency changes that would open up
newer opportunities for competitive advantage
•	 Fiscal and regulatory efficiency: MNCs are very effective at playing off one set
of national regulations against another while minimizing their tax obligations (e.g.
Burger King moving to Canada3)
Not surprisingly, international investment flows have reached levels not seen any time before.
This phenomenal growth has been helped by several factors:
•	 Technological advancement: telecommunications and information technology
•	 Emerging markets: fast growing economies in East and Southeast Asia promised
higher returns for global investors
•	 Economic reorientation: many developing nations committed to socialist planning
models switched to the market economy model
•	 Financial liberalization: lifting of limits on foreign investments or on foreign
currency holdings and exchange

6.5	 UNEVEN LANDSCAPE
These days, the financial choices available to investors around the globe involve foreign
assets and liabilities which in the common parlance of economists is referred to as portfolio
diversification.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Finance and investment

Since not all investments are of the same duration nor are they intended to serve the same
purpose, the globalization of financial markets cannot avoid being most uneven. While a bulk
of the global foreign direct investment takes place among developed countries. However, the
financial crisis of 2008 may have changed that configuration somewhat since the direction
of the flows seems to have reversed.
According to a 2013 report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD), the developing countries received more foreign investment inflows than the
developed world in the years following the last crisis. By comparison, Sub-Saharan Africa
actually lost a good share of the global investment during the same period. This presents a
very uneven picture when it comes to global investment flows.
As it happens, different areas of the globe have typically depended on different sources of
investment. The global capital flow patterns over the last decade show that:
•	 Latin American nations, the Middle East and Europe depended most heavily on
foreign portfolio investment
•	 Asian nations received most of their investment from foreign direct investment.
As may be expected, the factors that influence investment decisions are intimately connected
not only to the economic outlook of a country but also to the economic policy environment
within. When it comes to foreign direct investment, prospectors tend to look at:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

The rules and regulations that apply to foreign investors compared to nationals
The infrastructure of local markets when it comes to functional efficiency
Commitment of local governments to promoting a business-friendly environment
Trade policy and property rights
Restrictions on repatriation of earnings from investments

Since direct investment is often about gaining a controlling stake in a business and usually
involves direct ownership of physical assets, it cannot be liquidated at the drop of a hat. In
contrast, portfolio investments that deal with stocks and bonds and other creative financial
instruments could be promptly liquidated (see section 2.6).
As much as effective international linkages call for establishing smooth channels for the
flow of goods and resources across national borders, it inevitably creates tensions among
competing interests.

6.5.1	 NECESSARY COSTS

A big barrier to international investment happens to be transaction costs. After all, investing
overseas involves a lot of uncertainties that call for a lot of specialized research ahead of
time and these do not come cheap. Besides, the cost of intermediary services (e.g. brokerage
commissions) and other associated costs need to be factored into returns as well.
The cost of hiring analysts and researchers with familiarity with the destination markets
and having the necessary accounting expertise to wade through reams of foreign financial
statements and administrative hurdles could be quite formidable. In addition, there are
additional costs that cannot be avoided such as:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

stamp duty
trading fees
local taxes
exchange fees
transaction levy

After these fees have been cleared there is the additional fear of risks associated with investing
in another country. This is because the market value of investments can change dramatically
in the global arena.

6.5.2	 UNAVOIDABLE RISK

With the main attraction of international investments being the diversification of one’s portfolio,
a diversified financial portfolio is expected to reduce the overall risk of one’s investments.
The experts generally divide the risks associated with global investing into:
•	 Portfolio risk
•	 Currency risk
•	 Liquidity risk
The first of these could be reduced through diversification in the sense that if one’s money
is invested in a broad range of financial assets then the overall risk of the portfolio may be
reduced substantially.
By comparison, currency risk arises due to currency volatility. For instance, when investing
in a foreign market, one has to exchange the funds from the domestic currency to a foreign
currency at the going exchange rate. However, there is no guarantee that the exchange rate
is going to stay the same over an extended period of time.
Let’s say that an American investor expects a return of 8% a year on some investment in
Europe denominated in the euro. If the value of the euro depreciates by 2% in a year then
the net return on that investment must be 6%. On the other hand, if the euro appreciates
in a year then the effective return could be much higher.
Hence it is not surprising that a lot of investors choose to hedge currency risk using tools
such as
•	 currency futures or forward contracts (standard or customized contract between
two parties to buy or sell currency
•	 options (paying for an option to buy currency at a specified price on a future date)
Needless to say, these instruments prove to be too complex for the average investor. For
the faint-hearted there is the opportunity to buy ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) which are
readily accessible and relatively liquid.
•	 Note: Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) operates with the goal of achieving the same
return as a particular stock market index. These funds are increasingly popular with
investors and are listed on stock exchanges around the globe.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Finance and investment

This brings us to the question of liquidity risk which involves the ease of converting one’s
stocks or other financial assets quickly into cash. Often enough, foreign investments may carry
substantial liquidity risks which may cause investors to turn tail and return to safe grounds.
As may have been gathered by now, trying to minimize risk by linking up the stock markets
around the globe does not always produce the desired result. Often enough, it resembles
creating a giant casino that contributes to:
•	 a pyramid of promises stretching out over space and time
•	 the already very complex structure and mechanics of global finance.
Therefore, anytime something goes wrong somewhere in the intricate network of finance,
there could be devastating consequences rippling across the entire global economy. Very few
nations ordinarily have the resources to handle the fallout effectively.
6.5.3	 NATIONAL BANKRUPTCY

We got an earlier glimpse of this scary problem in section 2.9. It is however serious enough
to be looked at again.
On the face of things, since national governments possess both the power to tax and the
power to print money, they are a much better risk than private borrowers. Nonetheless,
sovereign nations can default on their loans now and again which can easily create a
nightmare scenario for global creditors.
Prominent economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have taken log of all the
sovereign defaults from 1800 until the early 2000s in their treatise, This Time It’s Different.
They count 250 instances of sovereign defaults in 200 years which works out to an average
of a little more than one crisis every year.
In the 1980s many governments of developing countries defaulted on their debt, a prime
example being Mexico in 1982. More recently, Greece defaulted in 2012 on euro-denominated
bonds that were held by banks and other investors. By the looks of it the trouble with
creditors is not over for Greece4.
While nations may not go to war anymore over unpaid debt, the options that are open to
find a way out are often limited to:
•	 loaning emergency funds to the distressed nations subject to stringent conditions
•	 imposing austerity measures to bring the defaulting nations back in line
•	 restructuring debt repayment plans according to an agreed schedule

6.6	 MAJOR PLAYERS
Over the last two decades four influential groups of investors appeared on the global scene
who benefited the most from integrated global markets. They are:
•	
•	
•	
•	

Major oil exporters with significant stashes of international reserve currencies
Sovereign wealth funds (e.g. national investment funds of export-surplus nations)
Hedge funds (usually private investment partnerships that invest in specialized assets)
Private equity groups (i.e. investors who directly invest into private companies or
conduct of public companies)

Before the financial crisis of 2008, all of the above qualified as significant power brokers with
considerable influence in global financial markets. By comparison, pension funds, mutual
funds and private endowments are not so significant as global players.
For the oil-producing countries a large portion of the revenues generated from exporting
oil may be channeled into areas not related to oil. This diversifies the associated risk. In
contrast, a sovereign wealth fund may be best described as a state-owned pool of money
that may be invested in a variety of financial assets.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Finance and investment

The sovereign funds arise out of:
•	 A nation’s budget surplus, i.e. tax revenues generated over and above government
spending
•	 revenues generated from exports or accumulated through a trade surplus
•	 foreign exchange reserves accumulated by a country’s central bank
Being state owned, a sovereign fund also has fewer restrictions on finding investment outlets.
A sovereign fund may invest in real assets as well as financial assets. In fact there is a whole
range of assets into which such a fund may be directed. The following are popular choices:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

corporate stocks or equity
corporate and government bonds
real estate (e.g. buildings and ports)
precious metals
private equity funds
hedge funds.

Among the other major players, a hedge fund is a limited partnership of investors that
usually possesses the following characteristics:
•	
•	
•	
•	

open to only a limited number of investors
requires a very large initial minimum investment
engage in high risk investment strategies for large gains
investments are quite illiquid with restrictions on time commitment

Hedge funds typically engage in risky investment strategies in both domestic and international
markets. The select strategies involve
•	
•	
•	
•	

using leverage (i.e. borrowed funds)
taking up long position (i.e. to buy an asset in future)
taking up short position (i.e. to sell an asset in future)
derivative positions (e.g. options and futures).

The last on our list of major players in global market are private equity groups. Private
equity refers to equity capital that is not quoted on a public exchange (e.g. the New York
Stock Exchange).

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Finance and investment

More often than not, private equity involves institutional investors and other large private
investors who can commit huge sums of money for extended periods of time. Private equity
groups tend to
•	 make direct investments into private companies
•	 conduct buyouts of public companies thereby taking them private (i.e. delisting
from public equity).
These investments may be used to fund new technologies, expand existing businesses, make
new acquisitions, strengthen the balance sheet of a company or take a distressed company
private with the intention of turning it around. The size of the private equity market has
grown steadily since the 1970s.

6.7	 ECONOMIC BUBBLES
As we have noted earlier, global finance is all about matching up savers with investors. When
global investment demand skips ahead of the amount of savings globally available then there
is a veritable boom in financial markets. In contrast, when savings exceeds investment it
might set off economic forces in a somewhat unsavory direction.
Since the U.S. is the world’s largest economy, it has both the biggest and deepest capital
markets. However, with the capital markets becoming increasingly integrated, no market
economy is totally immune from global turbulence.
Often enough, when an economy is trying to get out of an economic slump a central
bank might:
•	 lower interest rates to make overall borrowing easier
•	 try to stimulate growth through massive injections of new money (e.g. by buying
government securities).
After the financial crisis 2008 this is exactly what happened; the world’s major central banks
engaged in a multi-year campaign to hold down interest rates along with engaging in bouts
of quantitative easing (i.e. injecting money into the system). These were meant to ease up
frozen credit lines and make borrowing easier all around but could well have helped with
a renewed drive toward risky assets, rampant speculation and strategic gaming.

6.7.1	 RISKY ASSETS

The conventional investment outlets (e.g. new business ventures, real estate) do not always
offer attractive returns to investors. Hence the attraction of risky assets (e.g. stocks and
other speculative assets) that promise higher returns. This creates the possibility of a
speculative bubble.
•	 Note: Speculative bubble refers to a spike in asset values within a particular
industry, commodity or type of asset.
A speculative bubble has a tendency to feed upon itself inasmuch as exaggerated expectations
of future growth or other events trigger an increase in asset values. This in turn confirms the
bloated expectations thereby attracting more buyers who force prices even higher. Naturally,
the resulting inflation in prices eventually runs afoul of the economic fundamentals which
makes a burst imminent.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Finance and investment

There are two examples from recent history that illustrate the problem beautifully:
•	 In the 1980s a spectacular real estate bubble burst in Japan ushered in a prolonged
period of economic stagnation.
•	 In 2008 the bursting of the US housing bubble triggered enormous wealth destruction
on a global basis, paving the road to the Great Stagnation.
In our present day financial markets, speculation is rife as lucrative bets on exotic financial
assets continue to proliferate. This is likely to continue unabated so long as global interest
rates remain low and regulators choose to overlook the excesses.
6.7.2	 CURRENCY SPECULATION

Currency transactions fall into two different areas:
•	 primary exchange market: directly related to trade and investment involving the
exchange of real goods and services.
•	 secondary exchange market: a speculative market tied to shifting prices in
global markets
Not surprisingly, the secondary market (i.e. a resale market for securities) is much bigger
than the primary market (i.e. a market for newly issued securities) both in terms of size
and volume of trade.
Currency speculation is all about buying a foreign currency, not because someone needs to
pay for an import or plans to invest in a foreign business but because of hopes to sell the
currency at a higher rate in the near future. The trick of speculation is to buy low and sell
high thereby making as much profit as possible in the shortest possible time.
Of course some currency speculation is a necessary part of international trade so long as
there is a need to:
•	 Pay for imports and build up a reserve from exports
•	 Actively raise money for foreign direct investment
Most experts maintain that currency speculation generally works to benefit exporters,
importers and investors. This is by making it easy for traders and investors to buy and sell
foreign exchange as needed which in turn helps with market liquidity.

Thus it should come as no surprise that the turnover in foreign exchange continues to rise
on a fast clip so that the ratio of yearly foreign exchange market turnover to merchandise
exports which was in the teens in the late 1970s climbed to about 50 in the 1980s and
has doubled again since.
6.7.3	 STRATEGIC GAMING

The trouble with speculation is that it is basically a guessing game about the appreciation or
depreciation in the valuation of commodities, financial contracts and currency. Consequently,
the speculator must always be on guard to minimize exposure or risk.
This means developing clever tactical strategies for outmaneuvering the market. Unfortunately,
the strategies adopted for that purpose, no matter how sophisticated, often involve:
•	 Acting on biased information
•	 Relying on a “herd” instinct to follow leading speculators
•	 Using “forward exchange” markets that guide future actions (e.g. enter contract to
sell a particular commodity or currency at an agreed upon price at a future date)
It is often a combination of the herd instinct and self-fulfilling prophecies that sets the
stage for a financial crisis. Given that market players may not always get it right, they might
inadvertently trigger a panic in a mad rush to get out of the door.
Even seasoned strategists may sometimes be spooked by subtle changes in the economic
environment such as:
•	 Signs of increased government regulation in the making
•	 Tougher environmental standards coming down the pike
•	 Early signs of opposition from organized labor (e.g. unions)
When an artificial bubble eventually bursts most short-term investors are wiped out so
that the market can return to more realistic economic values. While gaming strategies may
not be the primary cause of an economic melt-down, they could make financial markets
especially prone to crises and turn a small problem into a giant catastrophe.
This makes it all too tempting to suggest that in order to avoid these unsettling possibilities,
the developing nations in the emerging markets should avoid getting short-term capital
altogether (e.g. portfolio investment). However, that in turn would:
•	 hurt the prospects of getting funds for good long-term investments
•	 limit investment opportunities for all investors while heightening the risk

We have to remember that capitalist systems ride on financial gambles which cannot easily
be separated from the chance of producing a higher standard of living for the best part of
the citizenry.
Thus businesses will always need ready access to funds to smooth out cash flow problems
but without a well-functioning capital market none of it is possible. Consequently, countries
that are aspiring to develop must do everything in their power to keep the channels of
credit and capital flows open.
This may make them more vulnerable to market swings than they realize but then again,
intelligent plans must always be ready on hand to prevent these possibilities which calls for
considerable international cooperation and sensible direction.

6.8	 SECULAR STAGNATION
Since the financial crisis of 2008 and the onset of slow global economic growth the idea of
secular stagnation has gained popularity among economists5. The concept was first introduced
into the economics lexicon by economist Alvin Hansen.

•	 Note: Secular stagnation as defined by economist Alvin Hansen in 1938 usually
results when a slowdown in population growth as well as technological progress
reduce investment opportunities in a market economy.
The appeal of the secular stagnation thesis fizzled in the post-WWII years as an economic
boom had returned allowing most market economies of the world to grow at a very fast clip.
However, the idea seems to have made a surprising comeback after the last financial crisis.
In light of Hansen’s ideas on stagnation, the global economy today faces the challenge of a
savings glut that cannot find profitable outlets. Understandably, without profitable investment
outlets, the savings and capital flows that pile up would cause economic growth to fizzle
and lead to economic stagnation over an extended period.
Back in 2005, Ben Bernanke, then chairman of the Federal Reserve System, argued that
there was clear evidence of a global savings glut in the making; he saw it to be the result of:
•	 Dramatic increases in the ratio of retirees to workers in a number of major industrial
economies creating a steady push toward savings
•	 Steep rise in U.S. current account deficit (i.e. more imports than exports) reflecting
a reversal in the flows of credit from the developing nations to the developed world.
These days, with the economic residue from the fallout of the last crisis still with us, it
seems to be getting harder to return the global economy on a firm growth path. Secular
stagnation theorists have begun to cite a set of key factors as responsible. The Economist
(2014b) provides us with a useful list:
•	 shrinking working-age populations in most developed economies
•	 Increased savings by an ageing populations that depresses consumption
•	 Rising levels of wealth and income inequality across the rich world causing an
increase in savings all around
•	 Slow increase in real wages in the developed market economies of the world
•	 Technological progress threatening a large number of jobs with automation
•	 Fiscal retrenchment (e.g. a push by governments to cut back spending and balance
their budgets)
•	 Cash hoarding by big companies (e.g. Apple and Microsoft)

6.9	 GLOBAL PROSPECTS
Looking over the last three decades, most economies of the world have undergone significant
transformations. The result has been:
•	 a substantial rise in economic transactions between nations
•	 a replacement of the role of governments by an increased role of markets
•	 a significant growth in financialization of global economies
This has created several challenges that remain front and center of the global economy. In
a 2007 report the Brookings Institution provided a useful list of challenges of which the
important ones are:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Energy and environmental security
Incidence of poverty and conflict
Face of competition in the new era of globalization
Problem of economic exclusion of youth
Power of global corporations
Global governance

Energy and environmental security is obviously the front-runner among all the challenges
listed above. This is because uncertain energy supplies and the growing possibility of
environmental disasters could easily compromise the long-term health of an economy and
society while also damaging national security.
Unfortunately, as globalization blurs the boundaries and borders between economic zones,
what may have once been distant threats continue to metastasize into immediate problems:
•	 an ongoing fight against global poverty that conflates into a struggle for global security.
•	 Advancing technology creating fierce competition for markets and jobs
•	 Alarming exclusion of youth as number of job seekers continues to exceed available jobs

Chances are these problems are going to get progressively worse as technology advances
at an even faster pace. Meanwhile the power of MNCs seems to be showing no signs of
abetting. This is often illustrated through:
•	 MNC monopoly over technological and intellectual property rights which allows
them tremendous hold over local and national governments.
•	 A simple threat of market withdrawal can bend local governments to the will
and dictate of MNCs given the speed with which goods, services, technology and
financial capital can move across national borders
Probably the biggest challenge facing the global economy of the future is that of synchronizing
economic policies across nations. Often enough, global trade negotiations reach a deadlock
as do efforts to coordinate strategies to fight nuclear proliferation or even to fight the everincreasing threat of pandemics.

More alarmingly, there are new trade pacts in the offing that may seriously undermine the
long term economic prospects of workers, communities and the environment. Take for
instance the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) talks that have been
initiated of late6. There appears to be a lot of opposition at the ground level even within
the EU regarding the trade pact. The specific areas of concern are:
•	 Settlement of trade disputes through investor tribunals that are believed to be
blatantly skewed in favor of powerful financial interests
•	 Compromising employment security by watering down existing labor standards
•	 Relaxing environmental standards and regulation
A startling feature of TTIP is the idea that international businesses could claim compensation
for government policy changes that might adversely affect them.
There is another storm cloud gathering over the companion proposal of Trans-Pacific
Partnership that was being forged behind closed doors which made it highly suspect; the
fear is that the secretive negotiations tend to further corporate interests rather than the
public good7.
Currently, the IMF is expressing concern that global financial risks may directly arise out
of a mix of:
•	 tight fiscal policy which means austere government budgets
•	 accommodative monetary policy that keeps interest rates low
This may very well prove to be an unsustainable mix in the long haul, not least because an
easy money policy tends to feed speculative bubbles especially when businesses are reluctant
to undertake investment initiatives in the face of a lackluster economy.

7	 POLICY QUESTIONS
7.1	INTRODUCTION
The question of economic policies arises because a market system cannot be left completely
to its own means without risking instability. One of the key problems of globalized existence
is that whenever something happens in a remote corner of the world it could easily send
reverberations all over.
The globalization of markets and production has introduced new challenges for society.
Most importantly, there have been considerable changes in the distribution of income both
within and between countries which continues to create economic and social tensions that
governments are called upon to address.
Very few disagree that globalization increases the exposure of countries to external shocks but
when it comes to balancing the domestic economic conditions with those of their trading
partners, national governments have a very limited set of options by way of policies.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Policy questions

The trouble is that national governments no longer have the freedom or autonomy to
address economic problems as they arise. They can no longer expand domestic demand
through various types of stimuli nor to adopt structural reform that conforms strictly to
domestic interests.
In this chapter we shall first look at the nature of economic fluctuations and then weigh
the macro policies designed to cope with them. This will lead to an examination of the
special challenges posed by globalization and how they are likely to impact the long-term
economic outlook.

7.2	 ECONOMIC CYCLE
The health of a market economy is usually judged by three things:
•	 The size of the national output or GDP
•	 The rates of job creation and unemployment
•	 Prices and inflation
Given the swings and shifts in demand and supply that are integral to market dynamic, it
is perhaps inevitable that there should be ups and downs in production and employment
over time. These are referred to as economic cycles.
An economic cycle is made up of the stages of growth, peak, recession and trough. A
sustained upswing in a nation’s GDP is called economic growth and a slowdown is called
recession. The trouble is that no one knows exactly how long each phase is likely to last.
As such, the symptoms of economic growth or slowdown are not too difficult to enumerate.
During economic growth:
•	 The demand for goods and services grows at a fast clip, fed by increased investment
•	 the inventory/sales ratio of businesses continues to fall
In many ways this is self-reinforcing inasmuch as growth raises expectations for further
growth which in turn triggers job creation and additional demand.
However sooner or later, the scarcity of available resources kicks in or else there may be
some unexpected event or disturbance that might upset the sense of orderly progress. This
is often called a supply shock.

There are many types of external supply shocks:
•	 an oil embargo imposed by OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries)
•	 A spate of bad weather or a natural disaster
•	 an unexpected bout of geopolitical uncertainty
Any of these could cause serious disruptions to the production cycle by driving up production
costs and fueling a whole range of uncertainties.
Inasmuch as businesses tend to pass on their increasing costs to their customers in the form
of higher prices, workers are likely to demand higher wages as well. Of course the latter
depends on the extent to which labor in the country are organized and the stringency of
the existing labor laws.
At any rate, any rising pressure of costs and prices is likely to slow down demand in the
economy and if timely policies are not adopted to neutralize the negative forces then the
economy may slip into a phase of recession.
As it happens, the downward forces could be equally self-reinforcing so that slowing
demand could bring about matching cut backs in supply which means layoffs and rising
unemployment.
A long time ago economists recognized that market economies may have a built-in tendency
to go through periodic ups and downs, almost by design. Orthodox economists tend to
blame the problem on:
•	 an inflexibility of prices
•	 institutional rigidities (e.g. strict labor laws)
•	 existing fiscal and monetary rules and regulations
However, the Keynesian economists who believe in the efficacy of macro management insist
on using sensible policy measures to neutralize an economic cycle. Unfortunately, there are
simply too many unknowns that could derail macro policies as was seen in the stagflationary
seventies. The crucial test of policymakers is to get the timing of preventive measures right
but as yet there exists no definitive way to neutralize an economic cycle.

7.3	 MACRO POLICIES
The three primary goals of policy making being GDP, inflation and unemployment, a
national government generally aims to:
•	 promote economic growth
•	 keep inflation under control
•	 achieve full employment
There is a broad range of macroeconomic indicators that policymakers regularly look at to
gauge the state of an economy’s health. They are:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

market interest rates
the level of average wages
the size of average household debt
the size of government debts
the size of trade deficits

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Policy questions

Chastened by the Great Depression and WWII, policymakers explored new ideas about
macroeconomic management. This led to the discovery of a set of suitable policy instruments:
•	
•	
•	
•	

monetary policy dealing with the domestic money supply and interest rates
fiscal policy dealing with taxes and government spending
incomes policy dealing with the security of incomes and benefits
balance of payments policy dealing with trade flows, capital flows and exchange rates

7.3.1	 MONETARY POLICY

The focus of monetary policy is on money supply and interest rates. Here the central bank
of a country plays a crucial role which involves:
•	
•	
•	
•	

issuing legal tender (i.e. official money)
acting as a lender of last resort
supervising banking activity
maintaining the value of money

At the heart of monetary operations is the monetary base that is shared by both the
nonbanking public and the banking system:
•	 Monetary base is made up of the financial assets (e.g. government securities) on
the basis of which banks conduct their lending activity.
While commercial banks tend to rely on private savings and treasury assets (mainly bonds)
to finance their activities, with globalization there are also other available channels for
securing funds. These days banks can also rely on foreign sources to fund both their lending
and borrowing.
The quantity of deposits created within a banking system is usually a multiple of the
monetary base depending on:
•	 Required reserve ratio: how much the central bank expects banks to hold on
hand as reserves
•	 Currency drain: how much the nonbank public is willing to hold in the form
of currency
Through their deposit and lending operations banks contribute to money creation that
supports economic activity. However, a present day market economy relies on constant
monetary innovations with which to facilitate transactions at minimum cost. Financial
intermediaries are essential players in that dynamic, ensuring the smooth functioning of
the economy.

The function of a financial intermediary is to:
•	 take the savings of depositors and channel them into profitable investment outlets
(e.g. interest earning loans)
•	 convert a liability (e.g. a bank deposit) into an asset (e.g. a credit line or a loan
to a business).
Since the business of banking is all about converting liabilities into assets, someone has to
make sure that the liabilities and assets are roughly in balance over an extended period of
time. This explains the need for the present day stress tests1 that have lately attracted a lot
of attention.
•	 Note: Bank stress test popularized since 2009 involves making up hypothetical
scenarios (described by the IMF as unlikely but plausible) that are unfavorable by
design, The aim is to determine whether a bank has sufficient capital to withstand
any of it. These tests are meant to inform both banks and regulators to take
preventive measures early on to prevent a full-blown crisis.
Stress tests are to ensure that money does not go off the rails. For instance, credit lines
could freeze up all of a sudden, thereby bringing the global economy almost to a standstill.
This calls for monetary policy intervention by the central bank.
Unfortunately, there are various competing goals facing monetary policymaking that may
often run at cross purposes. Consider for instance the goals of:
•	 price stability (i.e. controlling inflation)
•	 low unemployment and economic growth
•	 balance of payments equilibrium
These cannot all be secured at once. While the short administrative time lag of monetary
policy may be very attractive its actual impact may play out over a considerable time period
thereby introducing a significant element of uncertainty in global markets.
In theory central banks can expand or shrink an economy by altering the cost and availability
of credit in the economy. Unfortunately, a restrictive policy tends to be more effective than
an expansionary one since central banks can control the availability of credit but they cannot
actually force banks to lend.

Besides, there are global consequences to domestic monetary policy shifts. For instance,
an expansionary monetary policy move at home is likely to lower the value of a country’s
currency overseas, assuming that the exchange rate is flexible. This could also translate into
inflation at home.
On the other hand, if the exchange rate were to be fixed at the outset, then any attempt by
the central bank to ease up on credit is likely to cause global financial capital to look for
a fast exit unless of course the central bank stands ready to defend the currency in which
case the policy goal itself is frustrated.
Thanks to globalization, the effectiveness of monetary policy is closely connected to:
•	 the mobility of financial capital
•	 the presence of fixed or floating exchange rates
All said and done, it would not be an exaggeration to suggest that the free mobility of
financial capital could render monetary policy measures completely ineffective.

7.3.2	 FISCAL POLICY

Fiscal policy involves taxes and government spending. Just like monetary policy it is also
aimed at achieving low unemployment without inflation. Taxes in general are built into the
economic system as an automatic stabilizer. Thus tax revenues typically increase in times of
economic growth and inflation but shrink automatically in times of economic slowdown.
In other words, taxes tend to tone down the swings of an economic cycle. Of course the
stabilizing effect of taxation cannot always be counted upon given the time lag built into
fiscal decision-making and administration. Consequently, there is always a danger that fiscal
policy might amplify an economic cycle instead of neutralizing it.
What complicates fiscal matters more are the problems of deficit and debt. When the tax
revenues are not large enough to support expenditures the government has to resort to
borrowing which easily translates into an accumulation of debt over time.
Back in the 1970s and 1980s the spending by governments in industrialized countries began
to increase faster than tax revenues thereby contributing to rising deficits.
Interestingly enough, there were also other factors at play:
•	 A drift toward deindustrialization (i.e. shifting from manufacturing to service
industries)
•	 An overall economic slowdown triggering increased expenditures for transfers (e.g.
welfare and unemployment compensation)
•	 A growing interest obligation on a steadily rising public debt burden
As may be imagined, growing government debt burdens invariably raise questions about
financing. There are essentially three ways to finance a government’s debt:
•	 Relying on tax revenues
•	 Borrowing at home or abroad by selling government securities
•	 Borrowing from the central bank thereby expanding the monetary base
However, so long as the monetary base is not changed, any effort by the government to
borrow more creates the added problem of what economists call a “crowing-out effect”.
•	 Note: Crowding out effect refers to a shrinkage or crowing out of private sector
spending (e.g. consumption spending and investment) due to a rise in interest
rates caused by a government’s efforts to borrow in the face of an unchanged
monetary base.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Policy questions

The crowding out effect could pose a significant threat to economic health when:
•	 an economy is close to full employment
•	 public spending is a substitute for exports
•	 there is free capital mobility.
Much of this has to do with the idea that when exports do not pick up under an expansionary
stimulus then the public sector is forced to borrow at a higher interest rate.
In the previous section we saw how monetary policy is completely ineffective once the
exchange rate is fixed but the same is not true of fiscal policy. The latter is very effective
under fixed exchange rates and all the more so if financial capital is mobile.
This is because an expansionary fiscal policy sets off a chain reaction:
•	 it tends to raise the money supply
•	 this reinforces the expansionary effect of fiscal policy
•	 a fixed exchange rate prevents foreign investors from considering the fiscal expansion
to be reckless.
•	 the government has an easy time borrowing overseas and not have to adjust domestic
interest rates upward.
This is not to suggest that any sensible government could happily run deficits year after
year for a steady accumulation of public debt might eventually jeopardize the government’s
ability to borrow.
The issues of deficit and debt are of course closely related. While there are no definite limits
as to how far a country can go with its debt/GDP ratio (e.g. the ratio for Japan currently
stands at more than 200) it never fails to raise an alarm, especially in conservative circles
about what it might mean for the long term prospect of an economy. What is feared is a:
•	 severe economic contraction down the road due to pressures to finance the debt
•	 loss of confidence of global investors in the economic prospects of the country
Followers of economist John Maynard Keynes are not generally averse to letting the
government incur debt. This is because they maintain that deficit spending tends to have a
larger impact on income compared to trying to match increased spending with a matching
increase in taxes.

The trouble is that raising taxes is not an attractive political option in most circumstances.
Consequently, when it comes to alleviating unemployment through expansive fiscal policy,
policymakers choose one of two things:
•	 cut taxes across the board
•	 increasing government spending
Sadly, in either case, the result is a bigger deficit along with a bigger debt for the government.
Often enough public opinion latches onto the debt-GDP ratio as a good indicator of the
ability of a government to manage an economy. But by itself the ratio is misleading for it
does not accurately indicate whether the government is facing a serious risk of insolvency.
Consequently, frenetic efforts to bring down the ratio could prove to be extremely shortsighted.

7.3.3	 BALANCE OF PAYMENTS POLICY

Balance of payments refers to a combination of trading balance (i.e. between exports and
imports) and capital movements (see section 2.8). Ideally, the goods trade balance and the
balance of capital flows should sum up to zero but this seldom happens. The result is a:
•	 balance of payments surplus which means an increase in foreign currency reserves
•	 balance of payments deficit which means a decrease in foreign currency reserves
Persistent deficits can exhaust a country’s holdings of foreign currency reserve. Given that a
balance of payments equilibrium is an ideal long-run economic policy objective, however,
countries often seek to offset the deficits incurred in some periods with surpluses from
other periods.
However, there are exceptions; the U.S., a prime issuer of an international reserve currency
(see section 1.6.2), could presumably go on building trade deficits so long as the dollar
continues to be accepted globally.
Unfortunately, trade deficits cannot be racked up forever. Considering that the dollar is no
longer backed by gold, there is always a danger that:
•	 her trading partners might lose faith in the ability of the US to pay back her creditors.
•	 the dollar might plunge in value in global exchange
•	 there could be serious economic dislocations all around
All things considered, carrying a balance of payments surplus appears a better alternative
but that in turn has its own peculiar set of problems. A continuing balance of payments
surplus means
•	 Deficits for one’s trading partners
•	 A rise in the monetary base producing an upward pressure on prices
Thus globalization makes it possible for a country to export its economic troubles to others
or in turn import the problems of others. The balancing act becomes especially tricky
depending on the long term goals of a country.
If a country wishes to increase the global market shares of its national firms then a good
formula would be to:
•	 maintain a surplus on goods trade
•	 maintain a deficit on the capital front

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Policy questions

This calls for the domestic currency to be kept sufficiently weak which helps exports. This
is a strategy that has long been popular with China, much to the consternation of the U.S.
While maintaining a balance of payments equilibrium may be a worthwhile long-term objective,
it could still come up against a whole set of competing objectives. These may concern:
•	 promoting domestic competitiveness in global markets
•	 managing domestic demand so as to reduce a trade deficit
We have already seen how managing domestic demand could impact on currency value
overseas thereby impacting the balance of trade. Contrarily, efforts to reduce a trade deficit
may bring about restrictions in domestic demand which many increase unemployment.
In the face of such uncertain tradeoffs it is always tempting to play with the exchange rate
as a policy instrument but this is not as easy as it sounds.

7.4	 CURRENCY MATTERS
A country’s ability to control its exchange rate depends on the exchange rate regime to
which it subscribes. There are primarily two exchange rate regimes of interest:
•	 Fixed exchange rate regime (e.g. the gold standard)
•	 Floating exchange rate regime (i.e. free floating currencies)
Under a fixed exchange rate regime there is a preset band (around a central rate called
parity) within which a currency is allowed to fluctuate. Policymakers can alter the exchange
rate only by altering the parity or central rate.
In the mid-1990s a severe currency crisis hit Southeast Asia (section 2.6) which seems to have
been caused by an earlier currency market liberalization. When a currency is liberalized then:
•	 speculators are free to move in and bet on currency values moving up or down.
•	 currency prices tend to gyrate wildly thereby frustrating predictability in trade
•	 policymakers are forced to adopt desperate measures to fend off speculation.
A similar drama played out in Argentina in 2001 which is widely seen as a result of the
pegging of the Argentinian peso to the US dollar.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Policy questions

When a currency is pegged to the dollar (see section 1.6.4.) then any weakness in the former:
•	 compels the central bank to deplete dollar reserves (by buying back its own currency)
in order to shore up the currency
•	 triggers a contraction in the domestic economy which means economic hardship
for a lot of people caught off-guard.
As may be gathered, maintaining currency values is difficult in the face of free capital
movements. This has been especially true with the growth in eurocurrency markets.
•	 Note: Eurocurrency market is a market in which international banks borrow or
lend in a currency that is held in banks outside the country in which it is legal
tender. A good example would be the eurodollar which refers to the US dollar held
in banks outside the United States.
The general attraction of the eurocurrency market is not too hard to figure out. Compared
to domestic markets, the eurocurrency market offers:
•	 higher interest rates on deposits
•	 lower interest rates on loans

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Policy questions

Since the eurocurrency market happens to be largely unregulated, it is utilized by large firms
and extremely wealthy individuals who wish to avoid:
•	 domestic regulations on capital holdings
•	 domestic tax laws governing financial dealings
•	 domestic restrictions or caps on interest rates
Since domestic depositor protections do not apply on overseas holdings nor do domestic
rules and restrictions apply there, freely moving capital can fuel market volatility. This is
because as capital moves through the eurocurrency markets, any effort to defend a currency
can fuel uncertainty thereby upsetting a lot of plans for business investment.
For the most part, currency movements around the globe can make a lot of money for
speculators but do not necessarily guarantee an efficient allocation of resources although a
lot of free market advocates take exception to that observation.
At any rate, with international organizations being charged with monitoring currency
movements and detect signs of trouble so as to take preventive action in time, global
markets should feel safe and secure. Then again, the very same organizations are also faulted
for misdirecting global traffic or else to stand by and do nothing when a currency crisis
seems imminent.
For instance, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has on occasion been blamed for:
•	 reducing market discipline by acting as a lender of last resort
•	 not having enough financial resources for addressing a large scale global crisis
•	 imposing harsh austerity measures on the beneficiaries of its financial assistance

7.5	 FINANCIAL STRUCTURE
To fully appreciate the complexity of the global market dynamic, it is vital to understand
all the key pieces of the modern financial system. At a glance, this includes:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

financial markets (e.g. for stocks and bonds)
an infrastructure of payment and credit settlement (e.g. credit and debit cards)
financial trading mechanisms (e.g. options and futures contracts)
an elaborate network of rating agencies (e.g. Moody’s; Standard and Poor)
an insurance infrastructure to support financial products

There are however definite structural trends within the financial system that are worthy of
note. The features that readily come to mind are:
•	
•	
•	
•	

the financial trading and investment strategies that are changing constantly
a fast rise in innovative financial instruments and off-balance sheet activity
a rising incidence of financial consolidation that accounts for big market swings
households and private savers taking on greater risk (e.g mortgage markets)

As it happens, risk nowadays is great raw material for the financial business since information
technology offers lightning fast and very innovative ways to price and package risk into
marketable financial products for the broad global market.
To be sure, the task of market-making in the financial arena has been helped tremendously
by the creation of mammoth institutions that are distinctive in terms of:
•	 sheer size and scale of operation
•	 the enormous risk level at which they operate
•	 their complex interconnectedness
An added presence in that setup is the shadow banking system2 that appears not to have
been completely reined in by all the regulations that govern global finance.
•	 Note: Shadow banking system refers to the financial intermediaries that create
credit across the global financial system but are not subject to strict regulatory
oversight anywhere. Examples include hedge funds, and some innovative financial
instruments of credit (e.g. unlisted derivatives).
Since its members do not attract private deposits like conventional banks, the shadow
banking system has managed to escape regulation for the most part. Thus conventional
capital requirements do not apply to them which also enables them to engage in highly
risky activity without much accountability.
In a way macroeconomic policy serves as an insurance against downside risks but it can
easily lead to:
•	 systematic under-pricing of financial risk going forward
•	 increased adventurism in investment exposures using leverage (i.e. debt)
•	 proliferation of increasingly complex and opaque financial contracts

Clearly, macro policy intervention faces a very uncertain terrain here. In theory early
interventions may prevent financial risks from creating economic bubbles (see section 6.7)
but once such a bubble pops, any remedial action might even encourage bad behavior on
the part of strategists who are bent on gaming the system.
In addition to this the experts caution against making repeated attempts to fine tune a
mechanical or electronic system after a systemic malfunction. This is because the policy
instrument itself could then become unstable thereby leading the economy toward a freefall as best exemplified by the flash crash of 2010 when stock indexes collapsed but then
quickly recovered within barely a half-hour3.

7.6	 SYSTEMIC RISK
Inasmuch as the complex interconnectedness of all financial institutions may be ideal for
an efficient processing of information, it could also act as an amplification mechanism that
can easily turn a slight disturbance into a full scale crisis.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Policy questions

As it happens, banks and other financial institutions are continually exposed to three key risks:
•	 credit risk (i.e. a borrower might default on a loan)
•	 liquidity risk (i.e. ability to turn a financial asset quickly into cash)
•	 market risk (i.e. loss due to factors affecting financial markets as a whole)
The idea of systemic risk4 is often connected to “market volatility” or “market risk”. A
globalized market system is constantly at risk of its financial sector seizing up or breaking
down all of a sudden, thereby inflicting massive damages to the real economy.
In the popular jargon of investors, systemic risk cannot be diversified out in the sense of
reducing one’s risk exposure simply by diversifying the mix of one’s financial assets.
Systemic risk may arise from:
•	 a sudden failure of large and interconnected institutions
•	 the inherent imbalances within a system becoming cumulative over time
•	 a sizeable and totally unexpected external shock to the system
According to Hyman Minsky (2008), an authority on financial instability, market volatility
may be best explained in terms of a sequence of plausible events:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

During good times both consumption and investment spending increase.
A rising demand fuels even more consumption and investment spending
Investors increasingly are neglectful of the associated risks.
The slightest sign of a slowdown triggers a prompt re-pricing of risk
a steep unraveling of a credit boom follows, causing market seizure

Then there is the innate problem of asymmetric information that is an inherent feature of
a financial system.
•	 Note: Asymmetric information refers to a situation in which one party to a
transaction or exchange has more information compared to the counterparty. This
opens up the possibility of one party taking advantage of the other due to a simple
lack of information.

With the specter of asymmetric information ready on hand, the task of channeling the
savings of those unaware of profitable opportunities to those who know of opportunities but
do not have the necessary funds, gets frustrated. Economists call this an agency problem
that rides on the backs of informational asymmetry.
•	 Note: Agency problem refers to the inherent conflict between the interests of agents
(e.g. managers) and those of the principals (e.g. stakeholders).
It is widely believed that with the advances of technology in the information age, people
have easy access to a broad range of information; consequently, asymmetric information
may be on the decline.
Some experts believe that the problem may be best handled through:
•	 well-specified financial contracts
•	 clear standards of enforcement of legal contracts
However, no matter how well articulated, financial contracts and rules of enforcement do
not always allow for all manner of contingencies. This creates a real danger that personal
gains may be procured at the expense of steep social costs. A prime example is the massive
bank bailout in the U.S. in the wake of the 2008 crisis.
What makes the financial system an especially critical sector of a globalized economy is
the presence of:
•	 Sizeable negative externalities that can compound a systemic unraveling
•	 Information asymmetries that have been cited above
•	 Powerful feedback mechanisms that could amplify crises
All of these problems surfaced in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 that threatened a
global meltdown. Many commentators have since blamed the global catastrophe on:
•	 the speed with which the global financial markets had integrated since the 1990s
•	 the tremendous increase in leverage or debt piled up by global financial institutions
•	 sensational advancements in technology that allow instantaneous transmission of
information worldwide
•	 undetected accumulation of global imbalances over a long period of time

In view of the spectacular economic fallout from that crisis it is impossible not to agree
that individual behavior that is perfectly rational in the strictly economic sense could still
be remarkably wasteful in social terms. In other words, it may be foolhardy to expect
that financial markets can always be relied upon to guide optimal social allocation of our
scarce resources.
Legendary economist John Maynard Keynes famously considered the financial markets to
be ruled by “animal spirits” the taming of which is very difficult to say the least5. Besides,

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Policy questions

7.7	 SUPRANATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
As we saw in section 1.6.2., after WWII had ended, saner minds quickly returned to reinstate
the global channels of trade and exchange but with appropriate safeguards in place. The
Bretton Woods model worked beautifully for three long decades. Back then international
economic policy was supposed to be subordinate to domestic prerogatives such as maintaining:
•	
•	
•	
•	

full employment
economic growth
social insurance
a welfare state

Most significantly, the policies to regulate the global economy were conceived in the spirit of
multilateralism which meant setting the rules of operation through international organizations.
This worked well with the IMF and the World Bank along with GATT (see section 2.3).
The emergence of the WTO in 1995 signaled a sharp change in the orientation of globalization.
Since then the supranational institutions seem to have changed their orientation, apparently
to deal with newer challenges on the global front.
This has mostly meant:
•	 a more strict interpretation of free market capitalism than ever before.
•	 a push for more noninterfering national governments in the conduct of global trade.
In many ways, a completely new type of globalization has succeeded in reversing the priorities
that had once defined the Bretton Woods model. Thus domestic economic management has
come to be subordinated to the needs of international trade and finance.
Accordingly, there has been a definite resetting of the globalization compass. This has called
for a completely new set of rallying points for the global players that could best be listed as:
•	
•	
•	
•	

low corporate taxation
fiscal conservatism (i.e. tight fiscal policy)
financial deregulation (i.e. more financial innovations)
labor market flexibility (i.e. reducing union power)

Policy questions

Apart from maintaining balanced budgets and keeping monetary policy relatively flexible,
the new shift in direction suggested a more ambitious plan than ever before. Much of this
reflects a steady push by multinational companies for more market flexibility which of
course would undoubtedly help their international profit position.
The most visible changes have included:
•	
•	
•	
•	

bringing agriculture and certain services within the orbit of trade negotiations
extending WTO scrutiny to domestic health and safety regulations
New rules on patents and copyrights to establish international standards
Tighter controls on domestic industrial policy and import restrictions

Under GATT trade policies the dispute between countries had been mostly about tariffs and
quotas. However, with tariffs and quotas being gradually phased out over five long decades
since WWII, the focus of WTO shifted to removing what were deemed as remaining market
imperfections in the global trading system.
Henceforth trading partners could effectively challenge:
•	
•	
•	
•	

Tax systems within nations
Food safety rules within nations
Environmental regulations of countries
Industrial promotion policies within countries

As we look to the future, there appears to be growing resentment among the developing
countries about not having enough of a voice in the global trade negotiation forums that
tend to be dominated by the interests of wealthy nations.
There continues to be a considerable bit of tension between domestic prerogatives and
external obligations and this goes beyond the delicate balancing act of trade negotiations
toward addressing bigger questions about global economic stability6.

7.8	 CHANGING REALITY
Now we know, while globalization refers to an increased interdependence of economic and
social systems throughout the world, it also presents a formidable task of coordination, a
policy nightmare. As it happens, the fast movement of goods, labor and financial capital across
national borders alters the economic landscape but not always to the benefit of everyone.

Policy questions

Given that the proponents of globalization continue to emphasize the efficiency gains
reaped from integrating markets around the globe, there is also an ever-present threat
of social dislocation to contend with. A primary example is the phenomenon known as
deindustrialization across the global economy.
•	 Deindustrialization refers to the gradual decline in the importance of manufacturing
in progressive capitalism which is at times associated with a deskilling of labor (i.e.
redundant skills) as well.
Often hailed as a desirable shift from old-fashioned manufacturing to service industries, the
deindustrialization process appears to have serious long term implications for jobs and wages.
Globalization undoubtedly increases competition but it is as yet uncertain whether the
broader social effects are likely to be mitigated over the long haul. In particular, even the
developed world seems quite vulnerable to the long march of:
•	 large scale automation
•	 widespread computerization
•	 disappearance of low-wage, low-skilled work

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Policy questions

One of the leading areas of concern among economists is about the effects of globalization
on income inequality. Some researchers have discovered interesting contrasts in the patterns
of inequality (see The Economist 2012):
•	 a decline in global inequality as poorer countries have begun to catch up with
richer ones
•	 growing inequality within nations which is reaching alarming proportions.
Within developed and developing nations alike, much of the ongoing debate is about:
•	 widening wage differences between skilled and unskilled workers due to a so-called
digital divide
•	 a polarization of incomes leading to the disappearance of a solid middle class
After ignoring the problem for a very long while, the IMF has finally begun to admit that
runaway income inequality has the potential to:
•	 slow down economic growth
•	 cause or quicken the pace of financial crises
•	 weaken overall global demand for goods and services
Apart from the idea that runaway income inequality could give rise to social tensions there
is also a danger of fostering social pathologies, from obesity to suicide.
Sociologists and social philosophers worry that runaway income and wealth inequality could
also clamp down on social mobility and restrict the opportunity for advancement for vast
segments of the growing global population. These problems could easily make for a very
unstable world and that also in the not-too-distant future.

8	 PUZZLING PROSPECTS
8.1	INTRODUCTION
In this concluding chapter we shall examine the puzzles and paradoxes associated with
globalization. These will become clear as we look at the tensions that underlie the globalization
process. At a fundamental level, there remain questions of productivity versus distribution
that cannot be settled through free trade and integrated markets alone.
Most advocates of globalization prefer to ignore these pressing issues, claiming that market
processes will somehow cure all the problems in due course. However, it may be a mistake
to have too much faith in market exchange as an automatic mechanism that can address
all the tensions created by its own dynamic.
We shall first look at a few obvious paradoxes and puzzles underlying globalization before
turning to the economic success stories from Southeast Asia. This will lead to an examination
of the economic miracle that is China. The ongoing challenges that globalization poses to
policymakers will be summed up next before examining the possibility of a backlash to
the entire globalization initiative. The chapter concludes with a few thoughts about our
economic future.

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Puzzling prospects

8.2	 GLOBALIZATION PARADOX
Let’s say we create for ourselves an easy scenario, stretching from the early stages of development
in an emerging market economy all the way to mature growth. While globalization is widely
believed to release untold growth possibilities, the accepted formula runs on two basic tenets:
•	 very few things in life are beyond the pale of trading and market exchange
•	 a growing network of exchange is the key to improving the human condition
However, this prepares the ground for many puzzles and paradoxes as we shall see here.
These happen as market expansion often opens up possibilities of serious resource depletion,
corrosive social processes and even a loss of local autonomy.
8.2.1	 RESOURCE DEPLETION

Chances are, a country that just opened up to global trade may be best positioned to trade in
natural resources such as minerals and forest products. These resources may also be plentiful
and easily available from the outset; consequently, it is logical that the less developed nations
should rely on the export of natural resources as a first step toward globalization.
With access to the latest technology that globalization has on offer, it then becomes easy to
tap into all the natural resources that exist either above or below ground. Thus it becomes
all the more lucrative to engage in a massive exploitation of a natural resource base.
Consequently, the first impetus to development comes from marketable products or
commodities made out of:
•	 virgin forests
•	 pools of clean water
•	 pristine natural sites
Going forward, it is hoped that this clear development plan will shift onto supplying basic
staples for broader global markets. However, this may not always work out as planned.
8.2.2	 COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

Both the World Bank and the IMF recommend a formula for growth and development
that relies on:
•	 specialization in production
•	 open markets free of trade barriers
•	 a reliable monetary unit in terms of which to conduct trade

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Puzzling prospects

All of these are perfectly in keeping with the conventional notion of comparative advantage
that we had seen earlier in section 1.4. However, that idea also carries a crucial caveat about
the mobility of financial capital that most mainstream economists choose to ignore.
Once financial capital wins free mobility across national borders, the idea of comparative
advantage becomes practically impossible to define1. This is because with business interests
no longer being confined to the national boundaries it is not clear what constitutes
national advantage.
Of course this seldom dissuades mainstream economists from giving up on the notion of
comparative advantage as the rationale for globalization. Nonetheless, if the mobility of
capital were to be factored in then comparative advantage would have to be replaced with
the competitive variant. After all, large businesses can easily employ higher levels of efficiency
to eliminate competition, thereby capturing ever-larger market shares around the globe.
Understandably, a lot of developing nations have lately begun to complain about just that.
They see the global economic dynamic to be skewed in favor of the developed nations of
the world. This is the flip side of further capital market integration and trade liberalization
being pushed by the WTO.
This makes it difficult to dismiss the charge that the WTO, World Bank and the IMF may
be geared more to preserve the established positions of advantage in global trade than to
promote economic development around the world.
8.2.3	 COMMODITIES TRAP

Back in 1960, economist W.W. Rostow had envisioned five steps through which all nations
have to go in order to enjoy the benefits of economic development:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Traditional society relying on subsistence agriculture and little trading
Preconditions to take-off with emphasis on manufacturing and international outlook
Take-off: a short period of intensive growth and rapid industrialization
Drive to maturity with rising standard of living and increased use of technology
Mass consumption promoted by mass production and consumerism

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Following Rostow’s development template, the trade-based approach to development should
proceed according to the following script:
•	 A nation begins by exporting primary commodities and natural resources
•	 Then develops a manufacturing base and industrializes using foreign capital investment
•	 Gradually moves into more competitive industries and competes actively in
global markets
•	 Enjoys mass consumption and rising standard of living for most citizens
Thus when the trading circle expands, a poor country can easily capitalize on its innate
advantages of:
•	 making simple manufactured goods using an abundance of cheap labor
•	 attracting capital investment from the high labor cost nations (e.g. call centers)
However, the path may not be so simple. Once a nation chooses to specialize in commodities
and raw materials, it could easily get sucked into what is often thought of as a commodities trap.

•	 Note: Commodities trap refers to the inability of a nation to push through to
manufactures and other tradable products, i.e. a more broad-based formula for
development.
This is often because of powerful local interests that are entrenched enough to oppose further
economic development. Being locked into commodities production over an extended period
of time, a nation may have to:
•	 abandon the possibility of long-term growth and development altogether
•	 remain vulnerable due to exposure to the swings and fluctuations of global markets
8.2.4	 STRUCTURAL PRESSURES

Inasmuch as globalization opens the door to new technologies and new innovations in
products and processes, it calls for the development of critical capabilities at all levels of
society. This often calls for:
•	
•	
•	
•	

adapting foreign technologies to local conditions
ensuring that domestic workers acquire the necessary skills
assuring that the specialized inputs for production are home-grown
balancing complementary investments in diverse areas

However, any nation on the development path that has to be receptive to structural changes
may not be able to address it in an organized fashion. Consequently, the result may well be
a deepening of social fissures and mounting tensions between competing groups.
8.2.5	 STATE INTERVENTION

While a well-coordinated plan for trade-based development may promise great social gains,
short-term private profitability could also stand in the way. This pushes the state to take
an active role in managing a country’s economic development plan thereby challenging an
otherwise laissez-faire vision of globalization.
If the truth be known, ever since the financial crisis of 2008, most of the advanced market
economies of the world have shifted toward a more state-directed model of capitalism. This
is evident from the way big chunks of GDP were directed to:
•	 bail out big banks so as to save the global economy from a credit freeze
•	 stimulus packages to resuscitate growth and ensure economic stability

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

The trouble is that this kind of state interventionism introduces what economists call
market imperfections that go against the grain of free market competition. Consequently,
it is paradoxical that the best way to ensure free global trade may be by enhancing the role
of the state in directing markets.

8.3	 PRODUCTIVITY PUZZLE
Economists often contend that the cause of poverty is low productivity. As it happens, a
popular explanation of poverty is that the poor simply do not produce enough to feed,
clothe and house themselves adequately. Consequently, they are forever doomed to poor
health and low quality education which help perpetuate their unfortunate condition.
A whole host of factors could be brought in to explain this malaise. It may have to do with:
•	
•	
•	
•	

a lack of access to the latest technologies
an absence of opportunities for innovation
a general lack of education and skills in a population
a lack of access to credit

To add to it, in a world of market-driven production, the simple lack of access to
expanding markets may be a big reason for keeping broad swathes of a nation’s population
underproductive and poor.
What could then be better than to rely on globalization to reverse all that. Then again,
the countries that are best able to take full advantage of globalization need to possess three
necessary characteristics:
•	 A significantly large stock of fairly well educated and skilled workers
•	 A well-functioning legal system and stable governance
•	 Openness to foreign capital investments
Chances are, in the absence of any or all of these traits, trade could easily turn into cultivating
a lop-sided dependency of sorts between countries in the core versus those in the periphery.
In today’s world most nations fall into two distinct categories:
•	 Those at the core are highly industrialized and regularly take up a big share of the
global markets
•	 Those on the periphery concentrate mostly on the export of natural resources and
raw materials

ECONOMICS OF GLOBALIZATION

Being forced to strike a balance between the import of essential staples (e.g. corn) with the
export of nonessential goods to other countries (e.g. cut flowers), a developing nation in a
polarized world could easily slip into a lop-sided productivity growth pattern.
The problem is likely to be compounded as:
•	 the advanced countries in the core continue to enlarge their supply of skilled labor
•	 countries in the periphery keep their stock of workers deliberately unskilled so
as to capitalize on the outsourcing and offshoring of low-skilled work from the
advanced nations.
Thus as the long-term prospects of the advanced nations continue to improve that of the
developing nations could stagnate, making rising inequality an obvious outcome.
Admittedly the situation could improve once a developing country adopts advanced technology
but it does not put the advanced nations entirely off the hook. This is because advancing
technology could easily make vast segments of even a skilled population quite redundant.

Consider for instance the professional and highly competitive areas of medical diagnostics,
paralegal services and tax preparation. Only a short while ago these jobs seemed full-proof
against offshoring but not anymore.
Thus it is no surprise that there is growing evidence of an increase in the inequality within
countries while simultaneously making select groups of citizens across nations extremely
wealthy (The Economist 2012). Thus unbalanced outcome suggests that simply thinking
global and acting local may not offer a satisfactory resolution.

8.4	 ADDED TURBULENCE
Once a market is opened up to global economic forces of course, it has to be kept open
but this presents a whole new set of challenges. We could readily identify four critical areas
of concern surrounding the globalization dynamic:
•	 Health and safety
•	 Integrity of property rights
•	 Economic security
8.4.1	 HEALTH AND SAFETY

Consider for instance the salmonella scare on Mexican fresh produce a few years ago; it
alarmed the public against consuming fresh salads and uncooked fresh vegetables. A more
complicated but interesting case cropped up when the WTO ruled against the U.S. for a
ban on tuna from Mexico for using catching techniques that endangered dolphins.
The ongoing French ban on American steroid-treated beef may be discounted as a simple
case of overreaction but the American partial ban in 2007 against toothpaste made in China
which was found to be laced with hazardous chemicals was deadly serious.
Not surprisingly, the WTO is embroiled these days in a lot of controversy surrounding
unfair trading practices and there is no way to sort these out to everyone’s satisfaction. This
is in addition to the pressing need to monitor a whole host of safety standards surrounding
advancing technologies.
For instance, complex regulations and legal requirements already rule the auto, energy and
telecom industries. The first of these is famously riddled with concerns about emission
standards, seat belt features and air bags.

However, by far the most serious are the regulations that typically accompany
•	 nuclear technology in all its various applications from energy production to medical
diagnosis
•	 genetic engineering that extends from food production all the way to medical
applications
There are simply too many serious health and safety concerns in all these areas that we can
overlook only at our own peril. Nevertheless, without tacit agreement across nations to enforce
the necessary rules and regulations none of these concerns could be meaningfully addressed.
8.4.2	 PROPERTY RIGHTS

Free trade is virtually inseparable from property rights. Therefore, trading practices that
might impinge on property rights could short-circuit even the best laid plans of globalization.
As it happens, lucrative channels for violating intellectual property rights are opened up by
globalization. Hence the growing complaints against China about copyright infringements
on U.S. movies, music and software. Left unattended, these violations can deprive those
industries of hard earned revenues.
This makes it all the more important to establish clear ownership before trading can continue
but there is an additional need for law courts to enforce legal contracts. Add to that the vast
amounts of research and development expenses to support inventions and innovation and
we are talking about a huge national commitment in terms of time, energy and resources.
8.4.3	 ECONOMIC SECURITY

Often enough unrestricted trade can also lead to a general loss of economic security for big
segments of the global citizenry.
While it is true that imports tend to be a price depressant due to a feverish increase in
competition, if taken too far, an unrestricted flow of imports could also lead to:
•	 depressed domestic wages
•	 the elimination of jobs that were once protected by union contracts
•	 the elimination of long-standing work benefits and pensions
Naturally, the domestic workers thus affected may not easily find alternative jobs or even
decent wages and adequate income security.

These questions take a most unsavory turn when we factor in the role of child labor. It is a
reality we cannot ignore. Although it is justifiably frowned upon on humanitarian grounds
in most developed parts of the world, restrictions against child labor could also pass for
a subtle form of trade restriction designed to thwart the developmental aspirations of a
poor nation.
Given the scope all of these problems we have seen here, the fear of a race to the bottom
(see section 5.8) may be too palpable to ignore2.

8.5	 ECONOMIC CRISES
In the era of globalization, economic crises could arise out of several possible causes. The
following are especially noteworthy:
•	 geopolitical uncertainty born of some political unrest somewhere in the world (e.g.
the ongoing crises in the middle-east)
•	 natural disaster causing sudden stoppage or interruption in resource flow (e.g. the
2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan)
•	 sudden change of national policy direction regarding currency value or macro
stability (e.g. uncertainty with the Russian ruble)

Since the 1970s there have been several crises of note. One might say that the US going
off the gold standard in 1971 may have been instrumental in introducing a considerable
amount of uncertainty in global markets but that is a weighty question that cannot easily
be settled one way or the other.
Meanwhile, it is hard not to agree that the severity of economic crises has not decreased
over the last four decades. If anything, ever since globalization moved into high gear in the
early 1980s, the frequency of crises has increased significantly and every new crisis promises
to be more amplified than the last one.
8.5.1	 POLICY RESPONSE

As we have already noted, the economies that are globalized may have become more vulnerable
to external shocks while national governments have less maneuvering room either to:
•	 stimulate aggregate demand (i.e. the sum of consumer spending, business investment
demand and net exports)
•	 adopt structural reform (e.g. regulating financial high-rolling)
We have also noted that the conventional monetary and fiscal policy measures may not
be suited to handle the challenges posed by globalization. While diehard optimists may
find the unpredictability of globalization to be particularly exciting, what could be quite
unnerving is when the risk-taking activities of unruly prospectors begin to hit the middle
classes especially hard.
Ironically, the policies adopted to date to address a crisis fallout seem only to prepare the
ground for the next one. It is as if the global economy is destined to travel from crisis to
crisis rather than from crisis to solution.
8.5.2	 UNRESOLVED ISSUES

Ultimately we are faced with two critical questions that have long shadowed the discipline
of political economy:
•	 Could markets really be self-governing or self-stabilizing according to the ideal of
free enterprise?
•	 Is the public interest best served when private enterprise is allowed to operate
completely free from government interference?

These questions assumed critical importance in the wake of the near catastrophe triggered by
the financial crisis of 2008, widely described as the worst crisis since the Great Depression.
Since then the great economic powers of the world have put in place some safety precautions
but critics have disparaged them as at best half measures.
It is true that the precautionary measures adopted in the wake of the last crisis were focused
primarily on freeing up credit channels and restoring the financial industry back to health.
This meant that most of the fundamental structural deficiencies in the global economy were
for the most part left unattended.
Thus globalization hobbles along as a rather amorphous operational field wherein:
•	 the rules of the game keep changing constantly
•	 all the players are constantly pitched against each other, jockeying for competitive advantage
•	 national governments are on occasion totally bereft of the necessary resources with
which to address pressing domestic interests
All said and done, it would do us considerable good to remember that social gain is not
the same thing as private profits nor should the former be subjected to the terms set out
by the latter.

8.6	 ASIAN MIRACLE
Back in 1993 a World Bank report presented an impressive collection of expert analyses
on how a group of Asian nations had enjoyed spectacular growth since the early 1960s.
This group, also known as the Asian Tigers, included South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. What these countries had in common was a:
•	 dedication to export-led growth as the surest path to economic prosperity
•	 central role granted to their respective governments in guiding and coordinating growth.
For the World Bank this prescription to growth was a bit hard to swallow since it suggested
a blatant departure from the standard formula of laissez-faire market economics. Most
critical of all was the control that the state governments exercised over financial markets.
This meant that all efforts to accelerate industrialization and growth had to be coupled with:
•	 explicit ceilings on interest rates
•	 generous credit subsidies targeted at new industries
•	 stiff restrictions on capital flows in and out of a country

To add to it, an active government for nurturing a market economy is an accepted fixture
in the variant of globalization popular in Southeast Asia.
Accordingly, state involvement takes the form of:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

tax incentives for investment in designated sectors
direct supply of inputs to businesses
direct assistance to overcome bureaucratic hurdles
protection to nascent industries from global competition
explicit export subsidies to establish domestic firms in global markets

In view of the Asian economic miracle it cannot be stated with any amount of conviction
as to whether or not a state should play an active role in preparing private enterprise for
global markets. All we can safely say is that there is a need to be pragmatic about the role
a government needs to play to ensure that a market economy is firmly situated on a path
of economic growth.

8.7	 CHINA RISING
China is by far the best example of the alternative model of development popularized in
Southeast Asia. Most notably, China ignored most of the orthodox prerequisites for development
as laid out by the economic orthodoxy. This meant circumventing the stipulated need for:
•	 clearly established private property rights and rules of contract enforcement before
engaging in globalization
•	 thoroughly financializing an economy by establishing stock, bond and financial
markets that provide relatively free access to global investors
•	 embracing all the rules for complete market integration laid out by the WTO
Perhaps no country could have so completely gone against the economic orthodoxy and still
come out ahead. Most strikingly, the Chinese path to growth and development succeeded by:
•	 not relying on the export of primary goods and staples as a development strategy
•	 pushing for advanced high-technology products straight off in a labor-abundant
and relatively poor country.
Rather astonishingly, the economic strategies adopted by China did not deviate much from
the reigning political ideology of central government control over all economic activity.
Nonetheless, the Chinese policymakers were hugely successful in their readiness to experiment
with alternative institutional arrangements to figure out just what suited the needs of the
country best.
For the most part this meant:
•	
•	
•	
•	

utilizing township and village enterprises in lieu of private property rights
a gradual removal of trade barriers while opening up to global market forces
creating special economic zones for promoting exports and foreign investment
preventing the Chinese currency from being fully convertible in international trade

Thus the WTO prohibitions against export subsidies and other trade restrictions favoring
domestic firms were systematically disregarded by China. But by the time China joined the
WTO in 2001, a strong industrial base had already been established so that playing by the
global market rules proved not to be too difficult from then on.

Ever since joining the WTO China sharply reduced its tariff barriers and also began to
phase out most of its prior industrial policies. As yet there is no letting up of active state
intervention when it comes to maintaining competitive exchange rates however. Instead
very little is spared to:
•	 keep the currency (yuan/renminbi) artificially cheap in global markets
•	 keep short-term capital flows out thereby reducing market volatility
All said and done, it cannot be denied that China’s unusual strategy mix produced the most
spectacular bout of growth in a relatively short period of time. Accordingly, the Chinese
economy has enjoyed a doubling of incomes about every decade since the late 1970s and
staged the best possible economic miracle in the least possible time.
China has undoubtedly succeeded in a most unbelievable catch-up game with the developed
world. By some accounts this rapid pace of growth is widely credited for lifting about half
a billion people out of extreme poverty3.

8.8	 COORDINATION PROBLEM
As should be clear by now, as markets become more and more integrated around the globe,
the task of policy coordination becomes increasingly difficult. In fact a whole network of
supporting institutions is needed to keep markets operational and this rule applies equally
to global markets just as much to local and regional markets.
Evidently, the policy instruments adopted for securing domestic objectives also have to be
coordinated with the priorities of the rest of the world. However, this causes nations to be
caught in the cross-currents of:
•	 multilateralism: trade and policy coordination among several countries
•	 regionalism: creation of free trade areas or trading blocs among select groups of
countries
Since the 1980s regionalism has been in full swing with the formation of the North
American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) which led to the abolition of tariff barriers between the
US, Canada and Mexico. Furthermore, the European economic union movement gathered
momentum in the 1990s, concluding with a single currency, the euro, in 1999. In 1991,
several countries in Latin America also joined a trading bloc called Mercosur.

Here it is worthwhile to note that forming a trading bloc does not automatically mean
switching onto a single currency. NAFTA is a good example of a trade bloc without a single
currency agreement as also is ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations).
The visible drift of countries around the globe toward regionalism may be a clear indication
that the spirit of multilateralism that was the original impetus for globalization in the
post-WWII period may be on the wane. As yet the academic experts are not clear whether
regional integration or multilateralism will set the tone for globalization in future.
Clearly, managing a globalized economy without global governance is proving to be virtually
impossible as nations have begun to realize of late. In the past some powerful country or a
consortium of countries took the lead to smooth out all the wrinkles in the path of global
trade and exchange. The U.K. is a perfect example.
Evidently, the pressure of imperialism in the early days was very successful in holding the
global markets together since all it took was the political and military might of an imperial
economic power to keep the rest of the world in line.

In today’s world that role has been thrust upon the United States as the biggest economic
and military superpower. To a large extent, the G8 group of nations share some of the
responsibilities. As of 2008, the G8 consortium has included Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S.
While the diehard advocates of globalization continue to see globalization strictly in terms
of democracy and a market economy, present day economic reality suggests that multiple
pathways may be possible to secure that dream.

8.9	 RESETTING PRIORITIES
In our globalized existence externalities abound, as we have noted earlier (section 4.6). Add
to that mix the health of the global environment and there is no easy way to address any of
it. All of us are tied to the environmental commons and this calls for shared responsibility
on the part of all concerned.
While it is easy to say that positive externalities (spill-over effects) should be enhanced
through grants, subsidies and other incentives while the negatives should be minimized
using regulation, taxes, penalties and fines, it becomes a daunting task to coordinate these
across national borders.
We have already seen how economic growth and development are popularly seen to be
by far the best solution to reducing environmental stresses. This is because rising living
standards tend to bring about:
•	 A commensurate rise in environmental consciousness
•	 Newer demands for a better quality of life and aesthetics since the environment is
thought of as a valuable source of renewable capital.
•	 advancing technologies used to create better methods of extraction from nature that
are not only cleaner but more contained in the amount of externalities they generate.
By the same token, those countries aspiring to the high standards of living achieved in the
West must also be given a chance to catch up. Unfortunately, this could easily worsen the
environmental health for all concerned.
The idea that the middle classes in India and China strive to emulate western consumption
standards is already making environmentalists shudder. There is already considerable alarm
about poor air quality in some of the big cities in India and China.

Understandably, there is considerable push in the advanced nations for the development
of clean energies and the adoption of tech-intensive manufacturing methods. Undoubtedly
these are very beneficial in the long run.
Nevertheless, this is creating considerable tension in policy circles of late. This is not least
because even the most legitimate concerns about the environment could also be interpreted
as nontariff barriers.
•	 Note: Nontariff barrier refers to trade restrictions that take the form of anything
other than a tariff. They could take the form of quotas, levies, embargoes, outright
bans and sanctions. These are frequently used by the advanced economies of the world.
As it happens, a whole lot of international, public and private non-governmental organizations
have already begun to tackle that very difficult question. There is a lot of effort being made
to seek solutions to the environmental problems that routinely arise in our globalized
existence. The most prominent organizations that come to mind are:
•	 United Nations Environmental Program
•	 Greenpeace
•	 Worldwatch Institute
These global organizations are excellent sources of information about what is going on
in the environmental front. In addition, there is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC), a scientific body set up under the auspices of the United Nations in 1988.
Recently, the IPCC identified China, the U.S., the European Union, India, Russia, Japan
and Canada to be the top carbon dioxide emitters in the world4. Note that all the parties
involved are prominent players in the globalization dynamic which reinforces the idea that
there is simply no way to regulate emissions without addressing how a country ultimately
fares on the economic front.

8.10	 POSSIBLE BACKLASH
Given that globalization pitches domestic economic priorities against those of global enterprise,
there is always the possibility of a backlash.
If we are absolutely honest, the risk keeps growing every day as nations begin to feel
increasingly susceptible to economic crises that may not always be blamed on external
sources. It is not an exaggeration to say that the more monetarily integrated a nation is
these days, the greater is the risk of market volatility.

Back in the 1930s and 1940s, global economic integration had swiftly moved into reverse
gear thanks in large part due to:
•	 a hasty putting up of tariff barriers to close off markets
•	 the onset of a worldwide economic depression
•	 the eventual arrival of World War II
It is worth remembering that it took more than a quarter century after the Great Depression
for globalization to return to the level it had reached in 1900.
More often than not, unwanted crises triggered by external sources create an immediate
backlash against globalization. Broadly speaking, the possible sources of backlash could be:
•	 economic (e.g. impact of free trade and immigration on wages and employment
of low-skilled workers)
•	 political (e.g. concern about loss of national sovereignty and ability of the government
to solve economic problems)
•	 social and cultural (e.g. issues of fairness and social cohesiveness compromised
by global forces)

•	 health and security (e.g. promotion of universal brands of beverages and fast foods
replacing traditional diets and contributing to global epidemic of obesity)
•	 environmental (e.g. depletion of ecosystem services that are often underpriced and
overexploited)
These are clearly serious concerns and it is quite possible that in future these might conflate
into a ground swell of opposition to globalization.
The biggest problem facing globalization today is a combination of slower growth and falling
prices. Some leading economists have begun to call it a deflationary cycle.
•	 Note: Deflation is a fateful combination of falling prices and falling wages.
Technically it may be seen as negative inflation but as people begin to draw down
their debt, no amount of credit expansion can bring the economy back onto stable
path of growth.
It is often mentioned in the public media that Japan has been in the throes of deflation for
nearly two decades while the Eurozone is already showing early signs of the same malaise.
It is also not clear if the U.S. can completely escape the global economic drag altogether.
As may be expected, serious deflation can aggravate social tensions and trigger loud demands
for income redistribution from the disaffected. Unfortunately, where incomes are already
sharply polarized, it becomes very difficult to conduct meaningful dialog, let alone build
political consensus.
In the not too distant future, if the U.S. yields to domestic political pressures to reduce
its commitment to free trade then it is very likely that other nations will promptly follow
suit. This means that globalization could very well unwind and that also, rather sharply.
It does not really matter how advanced our communication and transportation technologies are
or how complex the trade and capital flows happen to be. A sharp retreat from globalization
could still occur so long as:
•	 the political forces of protectionism and isolationism are allowed to gain strength
•	 nations unwittingly fall victim to the untoward forces of depression or war
At this point it is not clear if the U.S. as the most powerful economic nation will have the
will power and wisdom to continue to remain committed to the bigger ideal of globalization.

8.11	 FUTURE PROSPECTS
So long as we are increasingly pulled between the opposing poles of living healthy versus
living comfortably and safely, globalization has no easy answers.
As we have already seen, securing economic growth often calls for:
•	 reconfiguring lifestyles toward relentless consumerism without which presumably
growth cannot be sustained
•	 displacing entire communities (e.g. tribes and forest peoples) in the name of
progressive development
•	 disrupting intact biospheres, often with irreversible effects
8.11.1	COLLECTIVE EFFORT

Consider for instance the intricate network involving agriculture, energy, industry, fisheries
and tourism. These are all interlinked, especially as they are all dependent on water resources.
Evidently, without a coordinated effort, the competition between agricultural versus industrial
and recreational water use could easily work at cross purposes. This calls for integrated water
resources management which in turn calls for bigger state involvement.
In extreme cases, policymakers might propose strict consumption standards but this also poses
a crucial challenge to the future of democratic deliberations. This is because it interferes with:
•	 consumption norms that are readily equated with one’s sense of self and the
fundamental right to free choice
•	 global media and advertising that constantly tend to magnify consumer needs and
wants as a part of free expression
Thus it is not possible to address all concerns surrounding globalization without coming
up against the question of individual freedom, be it concerning basic expression, personal
choice or economic enterprise.
8.11.2	GOING GREEN

As it happens, over the last half century the consumption of global natural resources and
water has grown at much faster rates than the global population. In response, some nations
have tried voluntarily to shift to technology that minimizes the impact on the environment.
This is of course a far better alternative than to confront individual self-expression head on.

The recent push for greener technology reflects that newfound sense of balance. Hence the
growing campaign for clean energy technology involving solar, wind, nuclear, battery and
clean vehicles. Encouragingly, renewable energy production around the world is said to have
doubled from 2006 to 2011 (Broder 2012).
Along with a concerted campaign to use materials that are highly recyclable and free of
many harmful substances there is the comparatively recent initiative to minimize electronic
waste and to find newer ways to recycle computers and cell phones that regularly end up
on the scrap heap.
The goal of all of these innovations is quite praiseworthy as they try to minimize the carbon
footprint of all the products that we consume. Then again, there are challenges associated with
any such an initiative5. This is because, any attempt to reduce the impact of consumption
on the environment tends to:
•	 expand the scale of consumption since the environmental negatives content is
reduced for each unit consumed
•	 create an accelerated rush to attain a certain level of development before a nation
can afford a broad environmental initiative.

Thus the issue of responsible environmental management gets caught up in the matter of
economic choices which in turn comes up against more vital questions about fair access to
natural and environmental resources and markets.
This problem is not likely to go away anytime soon as more and more countries are
encouraged to buy into the globalization formula of growth and development as laid out
by the IMF, World Bank and the WTO. Understandably, there is a growing demand for
creating a supranational body powerful enough to take charge of environmental governance
while minimizing the chance of economic strife.
However, there also continues to be a lot of opposition to that initiative, most notably from
the WTO. It is indeed ironic that the two countries that continue to oppose the creation
of a world environmental organization to coordinate international environmental policies
are the United States and China.
